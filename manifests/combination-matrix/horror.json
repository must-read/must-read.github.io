A Gothic horror where the crumbling estate and its doomed bloodline are reframed through Carter's lens — the madwoman is not the victim of the house but perhaps its author, and the narrator's fevered unreliability conceals whose story is actually being told. The architecture collapses inward as both Poe and Carter demand."

The domestic Gothic collapses into ontological vertigo."

A body horror where the protagonist's flesh begins changing — not into something monstrous but into something that no longer consents to being human. Machado brings the intimacy and the eroticism of metamorphosis; Ligotti brings the cold suspicion that personhood was the real aberration. The horror is not in what the body becomes but in how little the character mourns what it was."

The reader watches the narrator watching herself unravel and cannot tell if the camera is a mirror or a stage."
