A memoir essay about the body moving through American spaces that were not designed for it — airports, amusement parks, hospital waiting rooms. Gay's unflinching honesty about embodiment meets Thompson's refusal to be polite about what he sees. The result is a piece that is simultaneously deeply personal and wildly, angrily funny about a country that demands bodies conform to its architecture."

Coates's insistence that a child's body is never safe meets Dillard's insistence that a child's perception is miraculous — and the essay asks whether both can be true simultaneously. The political and the ecstatic forced into the same sentence."

The result is journalism that is both wildly present and deeply researched — chaos and order sharing every page."

Dillard makes the seeing feel like revelation; Solnit makes the digressions feel like the point."

The travel is not to a foreign country but through layers of a familiar one."

The essay is very funny and slightly ashamed of itself."

Solnit provides the associative leaps and the willingness to let the essay wander; Talese provides the grounding in scene, dialogue, and the specific textures of real lives.
