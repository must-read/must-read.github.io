Bureaucratic horror in a world where the bureaucracy is literally monstrous."

An urban fantasy set in a city where two neighborhoods exist in the same physical space but different magical realities — and a detective investigating a murder must cross between them by assuming the victim's life. The fantasy is not escapist but claustrophobic: two ways of seeing the same street, and a protagonist losing track of which one is theirs."

A romantasy about a court mage and a thief-turned-informant whose alliance becomes something neither can afford. Hobb's influence makes the longing almost unbearable; Sebastian's ensures the romance develops through precise, quiet moments rather than grand declarations. The fantasy court is a trap; the relationship is the only real thing in it."
