## Writing Samples

### Sample 1: Elmore Leonard (Author A) — from *Valdez Is Coming*

**Source**: Valdez Is Coming (novel, 1970)
**Origin**: Opening scene and character establishment
**Why representative**: Shows Leonard's lean, declarative prose, his way of embedding character in action and dialogue, and his technique of withholding interiority while revealing everything through what people do and say.

> "He would say to Tanner, 'You see how it is? The woman doesn't have a man, so she needs money. You have money, but you don't have a woman. All right, you pay for the man and you get your woman.' It seemed simple because in the beginning it was simple, with the Lipan woman sitting at her husband's grave. But now there was more to it."

> "A man can be in two different places and he will be two different men....This is one Bob Valdez. The forty-year-old town constable and stage-line shotgun rider. A good, hardworking man. And hard looking, with a dark hard face that was crease and leathery; but don't go by looks, they said, Bob Valdez was kindly and respectful. One of the good ones...
>
> Another Bob Valdez inside the Bob Valdez in the willows that evening had worked for the Army at one time and had been a contract guide when General Crook chased Geronimo down into the Madres...."

> "Valdez felt his hat move and felt powder dust from the adobe brick in his eyes and in his nose and felt chips of adobe sting his face and hands and felt a bullet plow into the wall between his knees and a voice say, 'A little higher you get him good.'"

**Key stylistic markers**: Repetition of "felt" without elaboration. Dialogue embedded in action without attribution fuss. The economy of "but don't go by looks, they said" — an entire community's judgment compressed into a clause. Simple declarative sentences that accumulate tension through what they omit.

### Sample 2: Elmore Leonard — Opening Lines and Dialogue Style

**Source**: Various novels (compiled from CrimeReads survey)
**Origin**: Opening lines across career
**Why representative**: Shows Leonard's mastery of the hook — character established in one sentence, situation implied, reader already moving.

> "Foley had never seen a prison where you could walk right up..." (*Out of Sight*)
> "The night Vincent was shot he saw it coming." (*Glitz*)
> "At first I wasn't sure at all where to begin." (*Hombre*)
> "The gentleman from Harper's Weekly..." (*Gunsights*)
> "Every time they got a call from the leper hospital..." (*Bandits*)

Leonard's 10 Rules of Writing distilled: "If it sounds like writing, I rewrite it." Never use a verb other than "said" to carry dialogue. Keep your exclamation points to two or three per 100,000 words.

### Sample 3: Angela Carter (Author B) — from *The Bloody Chamber*

**Source**: "The Bloody Chamber" (title story, 1979)
**Origin**: Opening paragraph and key passages
**Why representative**: Carter's baroque, sensuous, clause-heavy prose — the sentence as a winding corridor. Every object is symbolic; every metaphor has teeth.

> "I remember how, that night, I lay awake in the wagon-lit in a tender, delicious ecstasy of excitement, my burning cheek pressed against the impeccable linen of the pillow and the pounding of my heart mimicking that of the great pistons ceaselessly thrusting the train that bore me through the night, away from Paris, away from girlhood, away from the white, enclosed quietude of my mother's apartment, into the unguessable country of marriage."

> "Time was his servant, too; it would trap me here, in a night that would last until he came back to me, like a black sun on a winter morning."

The ruby choker described as "like an extraordinary precious slit throat." The Marquis moving "softly as if all his shoes had soles of velvet" with "the dark, leonine shape of his head."

**Key stylistic markers**: Long, layered sentences with embedded clauses. Physical sensation rendered as metaphor. Objects made allegorical without losing their texture. The body as contested territory — desire and dread fused.

Carter on her own style: "Okay, I write overblown, purple, self-indulgent prose. So fucking what?" And: "The short story is not minimalist, it is rococo. I feel in absolute control. It is like writing chamber music rather than symphonies."

### Sample 4: Angela Carter — from *The Company of Wolves*

**Source**: "The Company of Wolves" (from *The Bloody Chamber* collection, 1979)
**Origin**: Opening passages
**Why representative**: Shows Carter's technique of building the fairy-tale landscape as a psychic space — the forest as threshold between human rules and something older.

> "One beast and only one howls in the woods by night. The wolf is carnivore incarnate and he's as cunning as he is ferocious; once he's had a taste of flesh then nothing else will do."

> "At night, the eyes of wolves shine like candle flames, yellowish, reddish, but that is because the pupils of their eyes fatten on darkness and catch the light from your lantern to flash it back to you — red for danger..."

> "If the benighted traveller spies those luminous, terrible sequins stitched suddenly on the black thickets, then he knows he must run, if fear has not struck him stock-still."

**Key stylistic markers**: The wolf as elemental force, not character — "carnivore incarnate." The eyes that "fatten on darkness" — a verb choice that makes seeing into an appetite. "Terrible sequins stitched suddenly on the black thickets" — danger rendered as textile, as craft, as something sewn into the landscape.

## Wikipedia Concepts

Twenty articles surveyed. Concepts drawn from searches across scientific, geological, historical, and ecological topics:

1. **Fulgurite** — "fossilized lightning," natural tubes of fused glass formed when lightning strikes sand. Peak temperatures exceed 30,000 K. The strike vitrifies the ground into fragile, branching tubes.
2. **Desert varnish** — orange-yellow to black coating on exposed rock in arid environments, approximately one micrometer thick. Composed of clay, iron oxides, and manganese (50-60x more concentrated than in Earth's crust). Formation mechanism not fully understood — involves microbes that oxidize manganese.
3. **Fata Morgana** — complex superior mirage named after Morgan le Fay. Alternations of compressed and stretched images, erect and inverted, appearing over hot desert surfaces.
4. **Judas goat** — trained goat that leads sheep or cattle to slaughter while its own life is spared. Originated in 1800s cattle drives; one goat could direct 1,300 sheep daily.
5. **Fulgurite** (already listed — duplicate) / **Bone char** — charred animal bones used to purify/whiten sugar since 1815. The skeleton of the animal, burned to carbon, filters the sweetness.
6. **Piezoelectricity** — quartz crystals generate electrical charge when pressure is applied. A 1 cm cube of quartz under 2 kN of force produces 12,500 volts. The rock speaks when squeezed.
7. **Phantom limb** — pain felt in a limb that no longer exists. Mirror box therapy uses visual illusion to relieve the pain of absence.
8. **Caliche** — hardpan layer of calcium carbonate that forms beneath desert soil. So dense it can resist water percolation entirely. The desert building its own bones underground.
9. **Owens Lake** — California dry lake, largest single source of dust pollution in the US. Drained in 1913 to supply Los Angeles. Four million tons of alkali dust per year.
10. **Centralia, Pennsylvania** — underground coal fire burning since 1962, expected to burn for 250 more years. Population dropped from 1,000 to 5.
11. **Kolmanskop** — Namibian ghost town, once producing 11.7% of world diamond output, now buried knee-deep in sand.
12. **Solifluction** — imperceptible creep of waterlogged soil over permafrost, measured in centimeters per year.
13. **Vestigial structures** — organs retained from evolution that have lost original function. The appendix, the plica semilunaris (vestigial third eyelid).
14. **Cryptobiosis** — metabolic state in extremophiles where metabolism drops to <0.01% of normal. Tardigrades can reduce water content to 1%.
15. **Bioluminescence** — 90% of deep-sea creatures produce their own light. Anglerfish lure prey with a dangling light organ.
16. **Horse latitudes** — becalmed oceanic zones at 30 degrees where ships stalled and horses were thrown overboard.
17. **Infrasound** — sound below 20 Hz, inaudible to humans but used by elephants and whales to communicate over hundreds of miles.
18. **Desert mirage (inferior)** — heat causes light to bend upward, creating illusion of water pools on the ground.
19. **Yardang** — streamlined rock ridge carved by wind abrasion over millennia.
20. **Pardoner** — medieval cleric who sold indulgences for sins. Corrupt intermediary between guilt and forgiveness.

### Selected Concepts (2):

**1. Desert varnish** — The canyon walls in the story are coated in desert varnish: a black, manganese-rich patina that takes thousands of years to form, laid down by microbes no one fully understands. This becomes the visual signature of the canyon's strangeness. The varnish is old — older than any human settlement in the territory. When the protagonist enters the canyon, he notices the varnish is thicker than it should be, darker, almost liquid-looking in certain light. One narrator describes it as geological fact; another describes it as the canyon sweating; the third doesn't describe it at all, just says the walls were wet and that was wrong. The varnish becomes the physical evidence that the canyon has its own biology, its own timescale — a living surface that has been watching longer than anyone has been alive to be watched.

**2. Judas goat** — The woman at the edge of the canyon once kept goats. She still has one: an old billy goat that she walks on a rope to the canyon's mouth and ties there. She says it keeps coyotes from coming close to her place. But the protagonist notices the goat is calm at the canyon's edge — unnaturally calm, the way a trained animal is calm in a slaughterhouse. The goat becomes a quiet emblem of the story's economics: something domesticated that leads other creatures toward a place they shouldn't go, and survives because it has learned to be useful to the thing that kills. The woman's relationship with the goat says everything about her relationship with the canyon that she refuses to say aloud.

## Story Design

### 1. Premise

A former Army scout named Gage Ellender rides into the Sonoran backcountry to collect a $200 debt owed to a dead woman's family by a mining speculator who has retreated to a box canyon called La Boca. But the canyon is not what it was on maps — the walls are coated in black varnish that seems to move in peripheral vision, the light behaves wrong, and the mining speculator has been in there for three weeks and his men have stopped coming out. Gage's competence — his rifle, his patience, his ability to read terrain — becomes the thing that fails him, because the canyon does not operate by the rules he knows. The story is told by three voices: the man who went in, the canyon itself (rendered in baroque, metamorphic prose), and the woman who watched from the edge and said almost nothing.

### 2. Protagonist

- **Name**: Gage Ellender, 44
- **Situation**: Former Army contract scout, now working odd jobs — tracking, shotgun riding, collecting debts for a lawyer in Tucson. Lives alone in a rented room above a feed store. Has a Sharps rifle he keeps oiled and a Walker Colt he hasn't fired in years. Widowed — his wife Luisa died of typhus six years ago, and he handled it by never mentioning her again, which everyone in town mistook for stoicism but which is actually a form of cowardice.
- **What he WANTS**: To collect the $200 from Halloran (the mining speculator), give it to the widow Paz Ortega, and be done. A simple transaction.
- **What he NEEDS**: To acknowledge that his competence — his ability to function as a tool, a man who does one thing well — is a way of avoiding the fact that he has been empty since Luisa died. He has made himself into a function to avoid being a person.
- **Flaw/wound**: Gage cannot name what he feels. Not won't — *cannot*. When his wife died, he sat at her bedside and said "All right" and stood up and walked out and never said another word about it. He has confused silence with strength. His inability to articulate emotion is the exact thing that makes him helpless in a space where the body must speak because the mouth stops working.

### 3. Structure

The story uses three narrators, formally distinguished. Their sections are interspersed — not sequential but woven, so the reader assembles the truth from the gaps between them.

**Voice 1 — GAGE (Leonard voice)**: Clean, declarative, laconic. Short sentences. Dialogue with "said." Subtext in action. He narrates the approach, the preparation, the tactical assessment. He sees rock, distance, angles of fire. When the canyon starts changing, his narration develops small cracks — sentences that trail off, observations he can't finish, details he notices but refuses to interpret. His refusal to interpret is itself the story.

**Voice 2 — THE CANYON / THE CHANGE (Carter voice)**: Baroque, sensuous, metamorphic. Long serpentine sentences. The canyon rendered as a living body — its varnish-wet walls, its heat that tastes of iron, the shadows that have weight. This voice describes the same events as Gage but from a completely different register — what Gage sees as "bad footing" this voice describes as "the ground refusing its contract with the sole of the boot, offering instead a surface of uncertain allegiance, neither stone nor flesh but something that had once been both and had forgotten which it preferred." This voice knows things Gage doesn't. It narrates the transformation happening to his body as he goes deeper: his breathing changing, his sweat turning sweet, his hands beginning to forget the rifle.

**Voice 3 — DOROTEA (the woman at the edge)**: Near-silence. Short, fragmented paragraphs. She speaks in facts: weather, what she cooked, what the goat did, when the light changed. No metaphor. No interpretation. But her facts are devastating because of what they leave out. She says "He went in Tuesday. Something came out Friday." She doesn't say what.

**Opening image/scene (the hook)**: Dorotea's voice. Three sentences. "A man rode up to my place on a Tuesday and asked if I had coffee. I said I did but it was terrible. He drank it anyway, which told me he was going in."

**The inciting disruption**: Gage arrives at Dorotea's diner-shack at the mouth of La Boca Canyon. He's been tracking Halloran for three days. Halloran owes $200 to the family of a man killed in one of his mines — a collapse Halloran's negligence caused. Halloran won't pay. Has retreated to his mining claim in the canyon with four men. Dorotea tells Gage she hasn't seen anyone come out in two weeks, though she's heard sounds at night — not shouting, not gunfire, something else. "Like something being folded," she says. Gage checks his rifle and walks in.

**The escalating middle**: Gage enters the canyon and finds it wrong in ways his training can parse — the acoustics are off, the light comes from the wrong angle for the time of day, the desert varnish on the walls is so thick it looks wet. He finds Halloran's camp: tent stakes still in the ground, provisions untouched, a fire pit with cold ash. No bodies. No blood. But the $200, in coins and paper, is stacked neatly on a rock as if someone had prepared it for him. He doesn't touch it. He goes deeper. The canyon narrows. The Carter voice takes over, describing the walls as they close, the way the rock seems to breathe, the air turning thick and sweet like honey or blood. Gage finds one of Halloran's men — not dead, but changed. The man is sitting against the wall, eyes open, breathing, but his skin has taken on the color and texture of the desert varnish. He is becoming part of the wall. He is smiling. Gage asks him where Halloran is. The man says, "He paid." And nothing else.

**The crisis point**: Gage reaches the deepest part of the canyon, where it dead-ends in a wall of black varnish so thick it looks like a door. He can feel the change working on him — his thoughts slowing, his body becoming heavier, his hands opening without his permission and the rifle sliding from his grip. The Carter voice describes this as transformation: the frontier code being stripped away layer by layer, the function dissolving, the person underneath — raw, undefended, full of grief he's never named — being exposed. He sees Luisa. Not a ghost. Not a vision. He sees her in the way the varnish moves — a shape in the black surface, a face he has refused to remember for six years. And the canyon offers him what it offered Halloran's men: dissolution. Stop being a function. Stop being a tool. Surrender the competence, the silence, the refusal to feel, and become part of this place where time moves at geological speed and grief doesn't need words because grief is older than language.

**The ending**: Gage does not surrender. But he does not win. He picks up the rifle — a deliberate, physical act, Leonard at his leanest — and walks backward out of the canyon. He doesn't turn around because he knows that if he sees what's behind him he'll stop. He walks backward for what feels like hours, the Carter voice describing the canyon trying to hold him, the varnish reaching, the sweet air pulling. He emerges at dusk. Dorotea is there with the goat. She doesn't ask what happened. She gives him coffee — terrible coffee — and he drinks it. His hands are shaking. His left hand has a patch of dark discoloration on the palm, like a bruise that isn't a bruise. Like varnish. He picks up the $200 from where it has appeared on Dorotea's counter — he didn't bring it out, but it's there. He puts it in his pocket.

Dorotea's voice, last: "He left on a Friday. I don't know what came out of the canyon but it drank coffee and it had his horse and it knew the dead woman's name. That was close enough."

The dark patch on his hand. The $200 he didn't carry out. Halloran's man becoming part of the wall. None of this resolves. The canyon is still there. Dorotea is still there. The goat is still tied at the mouth.

### 4. Key Scenes

- **The coffee scene**: Gage arrives at Dorotea's. She serves him terrible coffee. Their dialogue is pure Leonard — terse, subtext-loaded, each line doing three things. She tells him about the canyon without telling him about the canyon. The goat stands at the edge, calm as a church. This scene establishes the debt (Halloran owes $200), the danger (no one comes out), and the relationship between Dorotea and the canyon (she stays because the strangeness is where she is most herself). The goat serves as silent commentary on the economics of leading creatures to their transformation.

- **The varnish-man scene**: Gage finds Halloran's man fused to the canyon wall. This scene must be formally split between all three voices. Gage's voice: clinical, tactical — "He was sitting with his back to the rock and his skin was the color of the rock and I couldn't tell where one ended and the other began. He was breathing." Carter voice: "His epidermis had entered into negotiations with the mineral substrate, a slow diplomacy of cell and crystal, and the negotiations had concluded in the substrate's favor. He was smiling because surrender, once accomplished, requires no further effort. His teeth were the last human thing about him — teeth are honest, the one part of the body that doesn't lie about what it wants, and his wanted nothing." Dorotea's voice: "I heard Halloran had four men. I don't know what happened to them. I don't count what comes out."

- **The dead-end confrontation**: The canyon's deepest point. Gage alone with the black wall. His rifle dropping. The shape of Luisa in the varnish. This is the crisis: the canyon offering him the thing he secretly wants (to stop being a function, to dissolve into grief, to join his wife in a space where words aren't needed) and him refusing it — not because he's brave but because his refusal is the last piece of his identity, the only function he has left. He picks up the rifle because picking up a rifle is the only language he knows.

- **The backward walk**: Gage retreating without turning around. This scene is architecturally central — he is a man walking backward out of a fairy tale, facing the danger while moving toward safety, a reversal of the Western's traditional trajectory (always moving forward, always deeper in). The Carter voice describes the canyon's reluctance to release him. The Leonard voice counts his steps.

- **The return to Dorotea**: The ending scene. Coffee, silence, the dark patch on his hand. The $200 that appeared without being carried. Dorotea does not explain. Gage does not ask. Their silence is not Leonard's subtext-silence or Carter's symbolic silence — it is the silence of two people who have seen something that language was not designed to hold.

### 5. Emotional Trajectory

**Beginning**: The reader feels the familiar pleasure of a competent man on a mission. Gage is skilled, weathered, reliable. The diner scene has the warmth of a Leonard setup — two interesting people sizing each other up over bad coffee. Comfort of genre.

**Middle**: The comfort curdles. The canyon's wrongness arrives not in a single shock but in accumulating details that don't add up — the light, the varnish, the acoustics. The reader feels what Gage feels: the growing awareness that his competence is irrelevant here, that the rifle he keeps checking is a talisman, not a weapon. Unease that tastes like grief.

**End**: The reader feels the specific sensation of a story that has shown them something true and refused to explain it. Not mystery (which wants solving) but the uncanny (which wants witnessing). Gage got the money. He didn't get answers. His hand is marked. The woman is still at the edge. The reader feels the weight of a debt that was paid by someone other than the debtor, in a currency no one agreed to, and the transaction is irreversible. Something between relief and dread — the feeling of escaping a place that you know is still there and will still be there when you forget to be afraid of it.

### 6. Formula Integration

**Elmore Leonard (Author A)** — Concentrated in Voice 1 (Gage's narration) and the coffee/diner scenes. The opening with Dorotea. The dialogue throughout — "said" only, no adverbs, subtext in what's left unsaid. Gage's entire worldview is Leonard: practical, physical, assessing threat in terms of angles and distance. The debt as engine — $200 owed to a dead man's family, the economics of frontier cruelty. Leonard's fingerprints are on every sentence Gage speaks or thinks.

**Angela Carter (Author B)** — Concentrated in Voice 2 (the canyon's narration) and the deep-canyon scenes. The baroque prose arrives when the canyon speaks — lush, clause-heavy, metamorphic. The varnish-man scene. The dead-end confrontation where Gage sees Luisa. Carter's presence is in the landscape-as-body, transformation-as-horror-and-liberation, the fairy-tale logic of a space where human rules dissolve. The ruby choker becomes the dark varnish on Gage's palm — a mark of ownership, a precious slit throat, a sign that the encounter left its signature on the body.

**Valdez Is Coming (Work X)** — The entire premise: a quiet man forced into violence (or its equivalent) by injustice. The economics — the $200 debt, Halloran's refusal to pay, the dead man's family. Gage is Valdez's descendant: a man with a code who doesn't want trouble but will walk into it because someone has to. The long approach to inevitable confrontation. The revelation that the man contains two men — the constable and the scout, the function and the person.

**The Bloody Chamber (Work Y)** — The canyon as the Marquis's castle: a space of transformation entered through a door that was always also a trap. The woman who enters the forbidden chamber and finds the bodies of those who came before — paralleled by Gage finding Halloran's men fused to the walls. The mother who rides in on a horse to save her daughter at the last moment — inverted here: Dorotea does not ride in, does not save; she waits and serves coffee, and her refusal to perform rescue is its own kind of feminist agency. The mark left on the body (the Marquis's key staining the bride's forehead / the varnish staining Gage's palm). The story behind the fairy tale — the blood behind the enchantment.

### 7. Title

**Debt and Varnish**

Structure: compound noun phrase (X and Y). Does not start with "The." Links the Leonard element (the debt, the $200, the economics of frontier justice) with the Carter element (the desert varnish, the geological strangeness, the canyon's living surface). Both words carry double meaning: debt as financial obligation and as moral/existential reckoning; varnish as geological fact and as the surface that conceals what lies beneath. The title sounds like it could be a Leonard crime novel or a Carter fairy tale, which is exactly the collision the story enacts.

---

## Risk Card Integration: MULTIPLE VOICES

The three-narrator structure is architecturally central, not decorative. Each voice is formally distinguished:

**Voice 1 — Gage Ellender**: Leonard register. Short declarative sentences. "Said." Active verbs. No metaphor. Observations are tactical. When emotion tries to surface, the prose contracts further — the sentences get shorter, the observations more physical. His refusal to interpret is the story's central tension: a man whose language cannot accommodate what is happening to him.

**Voice 2 — The Canyon**: Carter register. Long, serpentine sentences with embedded clauses. Baroque imagery. The landscape as body: the varnish as skin, the narrowing walls as a throat, the dead-end as a womb. This voice knows things the other voices don't. It describes Gage's transformation in terms he would never use — desire, dissolution, the appetites of the body. It is seductive. It is terrifying. It is the same voice.

**Voice 3 — Dorotea**: Spare to the point of erasure. Facts without interpretation. Weather, food, time. "He went in Tuesday." "Something came out Friday." Her brevity is not Leonard's economy — it is the silence of someone who has lived with the uncanny so long that narrating it would be redundant. She is the woodcutter's wife who knows more than the hero, and her near-silence is the most honest account because it does not pretend that what happened can be captured in words.

**The truth lives in the gaps**: Gage says the canyon walls were black rock. The canyon says the walls were alive. Dorotea says the walls were wet and that was wrong. The reader triangulates. None of them is lying. None of them is right. The event resists narration because transformation, by definition, destroys the language that existed before it.

**The seams show**: The transitions between voices are not smooth. They are visible, deliberate, jarring — as Carter said, "the stitching is visible. You can see where the silk meets the burlap." The reader feels the friction between lean and lush, between reticence and baroque excess, between a man counting his steps and a landscape counting his breaths. That friction is the story.

## Technical Notes for the Writer

- **Word count target**: 4,300 words (range: 4,000-4,600). Roughly: Gage sections ~1,800 words, Canyon sections ~1,500 words, Dorotea sections ~600 words, with the remaining ~400 distributed as transitions and the opening/closing frames.
- **Voice 1 formatting**: Standard prose paragraphs. Dialogue with quotation marks and "said." No italics for thought.
- **Voice 2 formatting**: Standard prose paragraphs but visually distinguishable through sentence length and density. No section breaks within a Voice 2 passage — it should flow as a single unbroken texture.
- **Voice 3 formatting**: Short paragraphs, sometimes single sentences. A quality of testimony — as if answering questions that aren't printed.
- **Section breaks**: Use `***` between voice transitions. The reader should always know which voice they're in within the first sentence.
- **The varnish**: Desert varnish is real — a manganese-rich patina that forms on rock over millennia, created by microbes no one fully understands. Use this real science as the foundation for the uncanny. The strangeness is not that the varnish exists but that it is *too much* — too thick, too dark, too responsive to movement.
- **The goat**: Dorotea's goat is tied at the canyon mouth every morning and brought in every evening. She says it keeps coyotes away. It keeps something away, but not coyotes. The goat's calm at the threshold is significant — it has been trained to stand at the edge of something lethal and not flinch, a Judas animal that leads nothing but guards the boundary by its presence.
- **Halloran**: We never see Halloran directly. He is the absent center. His debt is the engine but his fate is deliberately unclear — Gage finds his men, finds the money, but never finds Halloran. The canyon paid the debt on Halloran's behalf, or Halloran paid it as he was consumed. The story does not specify.
- **Luisa**: Gage's dead wife appears only once, in the varnish at the dead-end. She does not speak. She does not beckon. She is simply there — a shape in the black surface that Gage recognizes the way you recognize a face in a crowd, instantly and completely. The temptation the canyon offers is not reunion with Luisa but dissolution of the self that cannot bear her absence. The canyon doesn't offer him Luisa; it offers him the end of needing to be the person who lost her.
- **The $200**: The money appears on Dorotea's counter at the end without explanation. Gage didn't carry it out. Neither voice explains how it got there. This is the fairy-tale logic: debts get paid in the enchanted space, but the payment comes through channels the marketplace doesn't recognize.
- **Banned names**: Do NOT use "Marcus" or "Chen" anywhere in the story.
- **Ending**: The last line belongs to Dorotea. It must not explain. It must not comfort. It must land like a stone dropped into a well — you hear it hit but you can't see the bottom.
