  Okri's cyclical spirit-child cosmology and permeable world-membrane meet Morrison's
  incantatory prose where the dead return with unfinished business. Built on The Famished
  Road's cosmic threshold between spirit and flesh and Beloved's collective exorcism
  of historical violence carried in the body.
synopsis: >
  In 1990s Lagos, a woman inherits her grandmother's compound and the spirit-child
  who has died and returned for three generations. When the child speaks in the
  grandmother's voice, the neighborhood women must decide what to feed a hunger
  that belongs to the living and the dead alike.
combination:
  fromAuthorA:
    - The spirit-child (abiku) who cycles between worlds, choosing each time whether to stay or return
    - The road as cosmic threshold — Lagos as simultaneously sacred ground and profane marketplace
    - Cyclical prose rhythm where events spiral rather than progress, each return carrying new knowledge
  fromAuthorB:
    - Incantatory sentence structures where memory operates as a supernatural force inhabiting the body
    - The returned dead who arrive not as ghosts but as flesh, demanding recognition and accounting
    - The community must collectively name and expel what it has collectively survived
  fromWorkX:
    - The spirit-world pressing through the surface of daily Lagos life — markets, traffic, rain
    - A child who is both ancient and newborn, whose presence destabilizes ordinary causality
    - The famished road itself as metaphor — appetite without end, a hunger that is also a threshold
  fromWorkY:
    - A house that holds trauma in its architecture, that repels strangers and claims inhabitants
    - The body as site where historical violence is stored and inherited across generations
    - A climactic scene where women gather to collectively confront and release what haunts them

Before she was born the third time, Adunni had already learned that the living were the ones who could not remember.

The dead remembered everything. They remembered the taste of the first rain on laterite, when the earth cracked open its red mouth and drank. They remembered the sound the Ogun River made at its narrowest point where the water squeezed between rocks and produced a note — a single sustained note that could be heard only by pregnant women and children under the age of seven and dogs with one blind eye. They remembered the exact hour in 1947 when Mama Ekundayo, Adunni's grandmother's grandmother, had planted the mango tree in the center of the compound, driving the sapling into soil she had mixed with her own menstrual blood and the ash from a letter her husband had sent from the Burma campaign and never come back to explain. The dead carried all of this in their mouths, which is why, if you pressed your ear to the fresh grave of someone who had recently died in the Ajegunle neighborhood of Lagos, you could hear a sound like water running over stones. The dead were full of rivers.

Adunni's mother, Bisola, did not press her ear to graves. Bisola was a trader in Oshodi Market who sold bolts of ankara cloth from a stall wedged between a woman who repaired mobile phones and a man who sold secondhand alternators pulled from wrecked danfos. Bisola had hands that knew fabric the way a river knows its own banks — she could tell the thread count by touch, could detect a factory flaw at six paces, could fold a six-yard piece into a shape so compact it fit inside a single plastic bag from which it emerged, when unfolded, without a single crease, as though the cloth remembered its original flatness and returned to it out of loyalty. Bisola believed in what she could sell. She believed in the weight of coins in a leather pouch worn under her wrapper. She believed in the regularity of the danfo that left Oshodi at 6:15 in the morning and arrived in Ajegunle forty minutes later, or an hour later, or two hours later, depending on traffic, which in Lagos was not a condition but a state of being, a permanent weather, a theology.

She did not believe in spirit-children.

She did not believe, or she had decided not to believe, because belief and decision in this matter were the same muscle, flexed the same way. Bisola's first daughter had been born in 1982 and had lived for nine months and then stopped living on a Tuesday afternoon while Bisola was hanging washing in the compound and the child was lying on a mat in the shade of the mango tree. There had been no sound. No cry. Bisola came inside and the child was not breathing and her skin was already cool, already returning to the temperature of the air around her, as though the boundary between the child and the world had been so thin that it dissolved the moment no one was looking.

They named that child Adunni.

The second Adunni came in 1985. She lived eleven months. She died on a Thursday, also in the compound, also beneath the mango tree, also in silence. This time Bisola had been watching. She had been sitting three feet away, shelling egusi seeds into a tin bowl, and she saw — or she believed she saw, and belief was the same as seeing in this neighborhood where the veil between worlds was not a veil but a breath — the child smile, a smile of recognition, the kind of smile you give someone you are meeting at a bus stop after a long journey, and then the child closed her eyes and the closing was final.

The herbalist Baba Akin, who lived in the room behind the mechanic's shed on Kirikiri Road and who had been old for as long as anyone could remember, which suggested either that he aged very slowly or that he had always been old, said that the child was abiku. She was a spirit-child, a wanderer between the world of the unborn and the world of the living, and she came and went as she pleased, staying long enough to make her mother love her and then leaving, because the love was what she fed on, the grief was what she carried back to the spirit world as proof of her visit, the way you might carry a souvenir from a country you had visited briefly and intended to visit again.

Bisola listened to Baba Akin and then she went home and scrubbed the compound floor with a brush until the concrete bled white dust and her knuckles bled red.

The third Adunni came in 1991.

---

She came in the rainy season, when the gutters overflowed and the streets of Ajegunle became rivers themselves, brown rivers carrying plastic bags and mango seeds and the occasional shoe, and the children played in the water as though drowning were not a thing that happened, as though the water were simply another room in the house of the world, a room that appeared seasonally and had to be used before it was taken away. She came at night, during a power cut, and the midwife — Mama Joke, who had delivered every baby on the street for twenty years and who had hands the size of dinner plates and a laugh that reorganized the furniture — worked by the light of a kerosene lamp whose flame threw shadows on the walls that moved independently of the objects casting them. Mama Joke noticed this. She noticed that the shadows arrived before the objects that should have produced them, that a shadow of the child appeared on the wall before the child appeared between Bisola's legs, as though the shadow were the real thing and the child were its echo.

She noticed but she did not say.

The child was born with her eyes open. She did not cry. She looked at the room with an expression that Mama Joke, who had seen a thousand newborns and had classified their first expressions into categories — bewilderment, outrage, hunger, sleep — could only describe as patience. The child looked patient. She looked as though she had been waiting for this particular room, this particular kerosene lamp, this particular night of rain and shadows, and now that she had arrived, she was in no hurry.

They named her Adunni. What else could they call her?

Bisola held the child and felt the weight of her and the weight was wrong. Not too heavy, not too light, but wrong in a way she could not locate, as though the child's body contained something in addition to the usual organs and bones, something extra, something carried. Bisola held her daughter and smelled her scalp and the smell was rain on laterite and the mango tree and something older, something that belonged to the compound itself, the smell of the walls at night when the concrete exhaled the heat it had stored all day and released it as a faint, mineral breath that tasted, if you opened your mouth in the dark, of chalk and iron and time.

Bisola decided. She would not lose this one. She would hold the child so tightly that the spirit world could not pull her back. She would be a fist around this life. She would not let go.

The compound on Adekunle Street had been in the family since Mama Ekundayo built it in 1946 with money her husband sent from Burma before he stopped sending money and then stopped sending letters and then stopped being a person anyone expected to see again. It was a face-me-I-face-you, twelve rooms opening onto a central courtyard, and each room had held a different branch of the family until the branches thinned and broke and what remained was Bisola in her room and her mother, Mama Feyisara, in the room across the courtyard, and the mango tree in the center, and the ghosts.

The ghosts were not dramatic. They did not rattle chains or moan in corridors. They lived in the walls the way moisture lived in the walls, seeping through the concrete in the rainy season, leaving salt-white patterns that Bisola scrubbed away each morning and that returned each night in slightly different configurations. The patterns meant something. Mama Feyisara, who had lived in the compound her entire life and who had watched the patterns change for sixty years, said they were messages. She said the dead wrote on the walls the way the living wrote letters — slowly, with great effort, and with no certainty that anyone would read what they had written.

Mama Feyisara died when the third Adunni was four months old. She died in her room, in her bed, on a Saturday afternoon while the radio played Ebenezer Obey and the compound was quiet, and when Bisola found her she was lying on her back with her hands folded and her face wearing an expression of mild surprise, as though death had said something she had not expected — not something frightening, but something mildly amusing, a joke she would have laughed at if she had been given another second.

After Mama Feyisara died, the compound changed. The salt patterns on the walls grew more intricate. They spread from the walls to the floor, white traceries that followed the cracks in the concrete the way rivers follow the contours of land, branching and converging, and Bisola swept them and they returned, and she mopped them and they returned, and finally she stopped cleaning them and let them grow, let them map whatever geography the dead were trying to describe.

The mango tree fruited out of season. It produced mangoes in December, when no mango tree in Lagos had any business producing fruit, and the mangoes were sweet and dense and the color of a sunset that is trying to warn you about something. Bisola ate them. What else could she do? She ate the out-of-season mangoes and the juice ran down her chin and tasted of her mother's room, of the particular mix of mothballs and palm oil and Robb ointment that had constituted the smell of Mama Feyisara, and Bisola wept while she ate, and the weeping and the eating were the same act, a communion, a taking-in.

Adunni grew. She passed nine months — the age at which the first Adunni had died — and Bisola did not sleep that week, sitting beside the child through every night, watching her breathe, counting the breaths the way you count money when the amount matters. She passed eleven months — the age at which the second Adunni had died — and Bisola held her so tightly the child squirmed and protested, and the protest was so ordinary, so completely the complaint of a child being held too firmly, that Bisola laughed, a laugh that came from deep in her body, from a place that had been clenched for nine years.

Adunni reached one year. Then two. Then three.

She did not die.

But she did not entirely live, either.

---

The child spoke late. She was three before she formed words, and when the words came they arrived in a voice that was not hers. She spoke in her grandmother's voice — Mama Feyisara's voice, that particular low rasp that came from decades of breathing the compound's mineral dust and from shouting across the courtyard to children who never came fast enough. The words were Mama Feyisara's words, too. She said things the child could not have known. She described the Burma husband — his name was Sergeant Taiwo Ekundayo and he had a scar on his left wrist from a bayonet and he sang Yoruba songs in his sleep, songs from Abeokuta where he was born, and the songs had followed him to Burma and back but the man had not followed the songs. She described the day the mango tree was planted. She described the exact mixture — blood and ash and river water — and she described the prayer that was not a prayer but a promise, a contract between the woman and the land, a deed of ownership written not on paper but on the earth itself.

Bisola took the child to Baba Akin. The herbalist's room smelled of dried leaves and something sharper, something animal, something that made the nostrils flare and the eyes water. He looked at the child for a long time. The child looked back at him with Mama Feyisara's eyes in Adunni's face, and Baba Akin said nothing for so long that the shadows in the room moved, not because the light changed but because the shadows themselves grew impatient.

He said: *This one has come to stay. But she has brought someone with her.*

Bisola said: *My mother.*

Baba Akin said: *Not only your mother. Everyone. She has come carrying all of them. Every Adunni, every woman who lived in that compound, every child who was born and stayed and every child who was born and left. She is carrying them the way a river carries silt. The river does not choose what it carries. It carries what the land gives it.*

Bisola said: *What do I do?*

Baba Akin said: *Feed her.*

He did not say what to feed her. Bisola fed her rice and beans. She fed her pounded yam and egusi soup. She fed her fried plantain and chin-chin and the out-of-season mangoes that tasted of her dead mother. The child ate everything with the appetite of someone who had been hungry for a long time, who had been hungry across multiple lifetimes, whose hunger was not personal but inherited, a hunger that belonged to the compound itself, to the rooms and the walls and the mango tree and the salt patterns on the floor.

The child ate and the compound responded. When Adunni ate, the walls sweated more, the salt patterns grew, the mango tree dropped fruit that hit the courtyard floor with a sound like footsteps. When Adunni slept, the compound slept — the walls dried, the patterns faded, the tree went still. When Adunni laughed — and she laughed often, in Mama Feyisara's voice, a laugh that was too large for a child's body — the compound laughed with her, a subsonic vibration that rattled the louvered windows and made the neighbors' dogs bark.

The neighbors knew. In Ajegunle, where twelve families shared a single tap and secrets were common property, everyone knew. They knew Adunni was abiku, the spirit-child, the one who came and went. They knew this time she had brought passengers. They spoke of it quietly, at the tap, at the market, in the danfo on the way to work, and their speaking was not gossip but maintenance, the communal tending of a shared reality, because in this neighborhood the boundary between one family's story and another's was as permeable as the boundary between the living and the dead.

The road was where it happened.

Not a specific road — the road, the general concept of road as it existed in Lagos in the early 1990s, which was less a surface for vehicles than a living thing, a creature with moods and appetites, a deity that demanded sacrifice in the form of hours and patience and occasionally blood. The road between Ajegunle and Oshodi, which Bisola traveled every day with Adunni strapped to her back, was the road that Okri knew — the famished road, the road that was never satisfied, that ate vehicles and time and human intention and remained hungry.

Adunni loved the road. She loved the danfo with its painted slogans — GOD IS ABLE, NO FOOD FOR LAZY MAN, BABY IYABO — and its conductor who hung from the door by one arm and called destinations in a voice that was half song, half command, a voice that created the journey by naming it. She loved the market at Oshodi, the roar of it, the way ten thousand voices merged into a single sound that was not noise but music, the music of wanting and selling and carrying and counting. She loved the way the road changed depending on the hour — patient in the morning, furious at midday, exhausted by evening, dark and strange at night when the streetlights failed and the headlamps of oncoming vehicles created brief, sweeping revelations, illuminating for an instant a woman carrying a basin on her head, a goat standing in the median, a child asleep in a wheelbarrow.

The road was a threshold. Everything in Lagos was a threshold. The market was a threshold between need and provision. The gutter was a threshold between the street and the earth. The compound was a threshold between the living and the dead. And Adunni, the spirit-child, moved across these thresholds the way water moves across surfaces — without effort, without friction, belonging to both sides and neither.

She was five when she began to disappear.

Not fully. Not the way her previous selves had disappeared, through death, through the quiet cessation of breath beneath the mango tree. She disappeared partially. She would be sitting in the compound eating fried plantain and her left hand would become transparent, and through the hand Bisola could see the concrete floor and the salt patterns on it, and then the hand would solidify again and Adunni would continue eating as though nothing had happened. She would be walking along Adekunle Street and her feet would sink into the asphalt the way feet sink into wet sand, and she would pull them out again with a small sucking sound, and the asphalt would close behind her leaving no mark.

The compound pulled at her. The walls reached. The mango tree dropped its fruit in a circle around her wherever she stood, as though trying to build a cage or a nest or a grave. The salt patterns on the floor rearranged themselves when she walked over them, and the new patterns were not abstract — they were faces. Bisola recognized her mother. She recognized the first Adunni and the second Adunni. She recognized women she had never seen but who looked like her, who carried her jaw and her forehead and her way of standing with one hip forward, and she understood that these were the ones the child carried, the silt the river bore.

Bisola went to Baba Akin again. She said: *She is going.*

Baba Akin said: *She is being called.*

Bisola said: *By who?*

Baba Akin said: *By the compound. By the dead. They are hungry. You have been feeding the child but the dead eat through her. Every meal she eats goes to them. Every laugh she laughs is theirs. She is a door and they are walking through her, and a door that is always open eventually comes off its hinges.*

Bisola said: *Tell me how to close the door.*

Baba Akin looked at her and his eyes were old, older than his face, older than the room, eyes that had been looking at the boundary between worlds for so long they had taken on the quality of the boundary itself — translucent, shifting, full of movement that could be seen only peripherally. He said: *You cannot close it alone. A door belongs to everyone who uses it. The women must come.*

---

They came on a Saturday in June, when the rain had stopped and the air was thick and still and the compound felt swollen, like a body holding its breath. They came because Bisola asked and because asking, in Ajegunle, was the same as need, and need was the same as community, and community was the thing that kept the boundary between worlds from dissolving entirely, the collective agreement that the living would stay on this side and the dead on that side, even though everyone knew the agreement was provisional and the dead frequently violated it and the living, if they were honest, sometimes wanted them to.

Mama Joke came, the midwife with the dinner-plate hands, who had delivered the third Adunni and had seen the shadows arrive before the child. She came because she had never forgotten those shadows and because she understood that delivering a child into the world was only half the work — the other half was making sure the world kept the child.

Mrs. Adebayo from Room 4 came, a woman who had buried three husbands and had survived each burial by becoming harder, denser, more completely herself, so that she was now a person of such concentrated presence that the air around her felt slightly thicker and sounds near her were slightly louder, as though reality increased its resolution in her vicinity.

Chidinma from the house next door came, the Igbo woman who had married a Yoruba man and lived between two cultures the way Adunni lived between two worlds. She brought palm wine. She said it was for the women, but everyone knew some of it was for the dead.

Seven women in total, though the number wavered because the salt patterns on the floor, which had been faces for months, now rose from the concrete in pale ridges that looked, from certain angles, like the outlines of women standing, and whether to count them was a question no one asked aloud.

Adunni sat in the center of the courtyard beneath the mango tree. She was five years old and she was every age she had ever been, across every life she had lived, and her eyes held all of those ages simultaneously the way a river holds every rainfall that has ever fed it. The tree dropped mangoes around her, seven of them, one for each woman, and the mangoes hit the ground and did not bounce but sank slightly into the earth, as though the earth were softening, opening, becoming the mouth it had always been.

Bisola began. She did not know what to say so she said the names. She said Adunni three times — once for each child who had carried the name. She said Mama Feyisara. She said Mama Ekundayo. She said Sergeant Taiwo Ekundayo, the Burma husband who had not come back. She said the names of women she did not know but whose faces she had seen in the salt patterns on the floor, and the names came to her not from memory but from the compound itself, from the walls that had absorbed those names over decades the way they absorbed moisture, and now released them the way they released moisture — slowly, in the dark, through the pores of the concrete.

The other women joined. Not with names — they did not know the names — but with sounds. Mama Joke hummed. Mrs. Adebayo clapped a rhythm on her thighs, a rhythm that was not a song but a summons, a knocking on the door that Adunni had become. Chidinma poured palm wine on the ground, and where the wine fell the salt patterns dissolved and the concrete beneath was clean, truly clean, the kind of clean it had not been since before the compound was built, when the land was just land, red laterite without history.

Adunni opened her mouth.

What came out was not sound. It was not language. It was not Mama Feyisara's voice or the voice of any single dead person. It was a river. Not metaphorically — the neighbors heard it, the people on Adekunle Street heard it, the sound of water moving over stones, the sound the Ogun River made at its narrowest point, the note that only pregnant women and small children and one-eyed dogs could hear, except now everyone could hear it, because Adunni had opened the door so wide that the sound came through unfiltered, the sound of the dead remembering, the sound of every life that had passed through the compound spilling out of a five-year-old girl's mouth like water from a broken pipe.

Bisola did not run. She did not cover her ears. She walked to her daughter and she knelt and she put her hands on either side of the child's face, and the face was hot, fever-hot, the heat of a body doing work it was not built for, and Bisola said, in a voice that was quiet and was not asking but telling — *You can stay. But they cannot stay in you. Let them go into the walls. Let them go into the tree. Let them go into the ground. They can live in the compound. They have always lived in the compound. But they cannot live in my child.*

The mango tree groaned. The walls of the compound sweated, thick beads of moisture that ran down the concrete in rivulets and collected in the cracks and the rivulets were warm and tasted, if you touched your tongue to them, of chalk and iron and time and palm wine and egusi and the particular mineral sweetness that is the taste of a place where people have lived and died for long enough that the distinction between the two activities has become academic.

The salt patterns rose. They peeled themselves from the floor and the walls and they stood in the courtyard, twelve of them, pale and thin and barely there, like smoke, like heat shimmer, like memory when you are almost but not quite awake. Bisola could see through them to the walls beyond, and through the walls to the street, and through the street to the road, the famished road, which was waiting, which was always waiting, because the road's hunger was the same hunger that had pulled Adunni back and forth between worlds — the hunger for passage, for crossing, for the movement of souls between here and there.

The women sang. They did not plan to sing and they did not choose a song. The song chose them, rising from the compound the way the salt had risen from the floor, an old song, older than any of them, older than the compound, a song about a river that carried the dead to a place where they could rest, and the song named no river and no place but it created both, it sang them into being, and the pale figures in the courtyard turned toward the sound the way flowers turn toward light and began to move.

They moved toward the walls. They moved into the walls. They moved the way moisture moves into concrete — slowly, without drama, by absorption, by the gentle capillary force of a material accepting what it was built to hold. The walls darkened where they entered. The mango tree absorbed two of them, its trunk widening slightly, its leaves rustling in the absence of wind. The ground took the rest, the red laterite opening and closing like a mouth finishing a meal.

Adunni closed her mouth. The river-sound stopped. The courtyard was quiet. The compound was quiet. The whole of Adekunle Street was quiet, a held-breath quiet, and then a dog barked, and a danfo honked on the main road, and somewhere a radio began to play Fela, and the world reasserted itself, ordinary and loud and indifferent, the way it always does when the extraordinary has finished its business and stepped back behind the boundary.

Bisola picked up her daughter. The child was light. Not too light, not the wrong kind of light, but light the way a child should be light — five years of bone and skin and rice and beans, nothing more, nothing extra, no passengers, no silt, no rivers. The child smelled of herself. She smelled of sweat and the faintly sweet smell of a child's scalp after sleep, and she did not smell of the compound, did not smell of chalk and iron and time, and Bisola held her and breathed her in and the breathing was not a communion or a taking-in but simply breathing, the ordinary miracle of air moving in and out of a body that intended to keep doing so.

The salt patterns did not return. The walls of the compound sweated in the rainy season as all concrete walls in Lagos sweat in the rainy season, and the moisture was just moisture, carrying nothing, meaning nothing, tasting of nothing except itself. The mango tree fruited in season and only in season, and its mangoes tasted of mango.

Adunni grew. She grew at the rate children grow, passing through each age once and only once, the way you pass through a doorway — entering the room and not turning back. She spoke in her own voice. She ate with her own hunger. She laughed her own laugh, which was nothing like Mama Feyisara's laugh and nothing like Bisola's laugh, a laugh that belonged to no one who had come before, a laugh that was new in the world, which is, Mama Joke said, the only kind of miracle worth delivering.

The compound remained. The dead remained in its walls and its tree and its ground, but they remained the way the dead are supposed to remain — quietly, in the grain of things, in the taste of well water and the smell of rain on laterite and the creak of a door that has been opening and closing for fifty years. They did not write on the walls. They did not speak through children. They rested, finally, in the house they had built, and the house held them the way a mouth holds a river — not by gripping but by giving it somewhere to go.
