**CENTRO DE ESTUDIOS DEL SUEÑO**
**Departamento de Salud Municipal — Distrito Norte**
**Annual Case Index, Year Eleven**
**Compiled by: Dr. Lourdes Araya, Clinic Director**
**Reporting period: January 4 — December 19**
**Classification: Internal use. Do not distribute.**

---

**ENTRY 001**
**Patient**: Yolanda Estrada Ruiz, age 29
**Occupation**: Assembly line operator, Maquiladora Tectrón
**Date of intake**: January 14
**Referral**: Self-referred
**Presenting complaint**: Recurrent nightmares (4x weekly, duration 6+ months). Patient reports inability to recall dream content upon waking, retaining only a persistent olfactory impression described as "like pennies" and a spatial sensation of enclosure. Notes that the dream space "has weight." No history of parasomnia. No pharmaceutical sleep aids. Sleep latency within normal range.
**Somnographic findings**: Stage 3 NREM architecture unremarkable. REM onset at 87 minutes. REM waveform shows standard desynchronized low-voltage activity with one anomaly: a sustained 14.2 Hz oscillation in the left temporal region, duration 4.3 minutes, not correlated with eye movement. Frequency not consistent with known spindle activity. Flagged for follow-up.
**Clinician notes**: Patient cooperative, affect flat. Described the dream space as "a building with no windows." Could not elaborate. Prescribed sleep hygiene protocol. Scheduled polysomnographic follow-up for February 11.
**Status**: Treatment ongoing.

---

**ENTRY 002**
**Patient**: Dolores Fernández Ibarra, age 34
**Occupation**: Domestic worker
**Date of intake**: February 2
**Referral**: Primary care physician, Clínica del Pueblo
**Presenting complaint**: Severe sleep fragmentation and recurring nightmare. Patient describes the dream as involving a structure she cannot name or draw but insists is "real." Reports a copper smell that persists for several minutes after waking. States that in the dream, the walls of the structure are "warm, like skin." Onset approximately eight months prior.
**Somnographic findings**: Elevated sleep fragmentation index (23 arousals/hour). REM waveform shows the same 14.2 Hz left temporal oscillation observed in Entry 001, duration 5.1 minutes. Cross-reference noted.
**Clinician notes**: Patient visibly distressed. Hands trembling during interview. When asked to describe the structure in her dream, she placed both palms flat on the examination table and said, "It is the size of everything." Recommended cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia. Referred to psychiatric services for anxiety evaluation.
**Status**: Patient failed to attend follow-up appointment (March 6). File transferred to inactive. No forwarding contact information on record.

---

**ENTRY 003**
**Patient**: Isabel Carrizo Duarte, age 22
**Occupation**: Student, Universidad del Norte (civil engineering, third year)
**Date of intake**: March 11
**Referral**: University health services
**Presenting complaint**: Recurring nightmare with identical features to Entries 001 and 002: enclosed structure, no windows, copper smell, sensation of weight or compression. Patient describes feeling that the structure is "inside my chest, or I am inside its chest — I can't tell which." Onset five months prior. Reports recent grades declining. Reports that two friends from her dormitory have also experienced similar dreams but refused to seek treatment.
**Somnographic findings**: REM waveform displays the 14.2 Hz oscillation. Duration 6.7 minutes, the longest recorded to date. Oscillation shows a slight morphological drift — waveform begins sinusoidal but develops increasingly angular peaks by the third minute, as though something within the signal is sharpening.
**Clinician notes**: Third patient presenting with the same frequency anomaly. I have searched the literature for precedent. There is none. The oscillation does not correspond to any catalogued spindle, artifact, or pathological waveform. It is clean and replicable across three separate patients using three separate electrode sets. I am naming it provisionally for internal reference: the "architecture frequency."
**Status**: Patient failed to attend follow-up (April 2). Missing persons report filed by mother, Graciela Carrizo, on April 9 (see Appendix C, Entry 1).

**INTER-OFFICE MEMORANDUM**
**From**: Lic. Héctor Bonilla Preciado, Municipal Health Authority, Subdirectorate of Clinical Services
**To**: Dr. Lourdes Araya, Centro de Estudios del Sueño
**Date**: April 16
**Re**: Patient attrition rate

Dr. Araya — Our records indicate that your facility has transferred three patient files to inactive status in the current reporting period, with one associated missing persons cross-reference. Please note that patient attrition documentation falls under the purview of Administrative Services, not clinical indexing. We request that future case indices omit missing persons references, which are outside the scope of your reporting mandate. A clean index is appreciated.

> *He wants a clean index. I went back to the January polysomnograms last night. I pulled Pilar's file from the bottom drawer — her last recording, the one from the Hospital del Salvador, 1998. The printout is brown at the edges. The ink is fading. But the waveform is there. 14.2 Hz, left temporal, angular peaks. Pilar had this. Twenty-eight years ago, Pilar had this same frequency. And no one named it then either.*

**ENTRY 004**
**Patient**: Teresa Lucía Mondragón, age 31
**Occupation**: Waitress, Restaurante La Frontera
**Date of intake**: April 22
**Presenting complaint**: Recurring nightmare consistent with previous entries. Patient describes the enclosed structure, copper olfactory component, and sensation of weight or compression. Onset approximately seven months prior. She was calm. She spoke about the building the way one describes a room in one's house.
**Somnographic findings**: Architecture frequency present. Duration 7.2 minutes. Amplitude increasing relative to Entries 001-003. Paired peaks not yet observed.
**Clinician notes**: Fourth presentation. I am no longer requesting equipment calibration.
**Status**: Treatment ongoing. Patient last seen May 3.

---

**ENTRY 005**
**Patient**: Amalia Rojas Cifuentes, age 26
**Occupation**: Pharmacy clerk, Farmacia del Ángel (the pharmacy below my apartment — I sold her cough medicine last week and did not realize until she sat down in the intake chair that she was the woman from behind the counter, the one who always asks me if I am sleeping well)
**Date of intake**: May 15
**Presenting complaint**: Same. Identical. She said the building was getting larger.
**Somnographic findings**: Architecture frequency, 8.1 minutes, exhibiting a new morphological feature: the angular peaks have begun to appear in pairs, the second peak slightly delayed, as though the signal is echoing off an interior surface.
**Clinician notes**: Five patients. Five identical anomalous waveforms. I submitted a report to the Municipal Health Authority requesting a public health inquiry. The report was acknowledged. No inquiry has been opened.
**Status**: File transferred to inactive. Last known contact: June 4.

---

**ENTRY 006**
**Patient**: Graciela Molina Sandoval, age 38
**Occupation**: Night janitor, Maquiladora Electrosur
**Date of intake**: June 9
**Presenting complaint**: Patient does not describe a building. Patient describes "a mouth." She says she enters the mouth and inside the mouth there is a hallway and inside the hallway there are doors and behind each door there is a room containing a woman lying on a table with wires attached to her head and each woman is asleep and each woman is dreaming of entering a mouth. I transcribed this verbatim. She was not agitated. She spoke in the tone one uses to describe a commute.
**Somnographic findings**: Architecture frequency. Duration 11.4 minutes, an increase of 340% over Entry 001. The paired peaks are now accompanied by a low-frequency sub-harmonic that was not present in earlier recordings. The sub-harmonic registers at 0.7 Hz, below the threshold of conscious perception, in the range associated with cortical slow oscillations during deep sleep. It should not be present during REM. It is present during REM. The equipment is recording something that should not exist in this stage of sleep. I requested a calibration check.
**Calibration report** (June 12): All equipment within manufacturer specifications. No anomalies detected.
**Status**: Patient failed to attend follow-up. No missing persons report filed. No known family contact on record.

> *Graciela Molina worked nights. She cleaned the offices of a factory that makes wiring harnesses for American automobiles. She came to the clinic at 7 a.m. on a Tuesday, still in her work uniform, and told me about the mouth. I asked her: "What does it smell like, inside the mouth?" She said: "Copper." I asked her: "Are you afraid?" She said: "I don't think it matters if I am afraid." I have been thinking about this answer for four months. I have not stopped thinking about this answer.*

---

**ENTRY 007**
**Patient**: Luz Elena Acevedo Parra, age 24
**Occupation**: Factory worker, Maquiladora Tectrón (same facility as Entry 001)
**Date of intake**: July 7
**Presenting complaint**: Recurring dream of enclosed structure. Copper smell. Describes the walls as "breathing." States that she can hear other women sleeping inside the walls. When asked how many women, she closed her eyes and appeared to count, moving her lips without sound for nearly a full minute, and then said, "More every night."
**Somnographic findings**: Architecture frequency, 9.3 min. Paired peaks. Sub-harmonic present. New observation: during the final 2.1 minutes of the architecture frequency, the patient's waveform exhibited a phenomenon I can only describe as layering — the primary oscillation seemed to contain secondary waveforms nested within its amplitude, as though the signal were folding over itself, as though the patient's sleeping brain were producing not one dream but several simultaneously, stacked. I pulled the electrode leads to check for crosstalk. There was none. The layering was endogenous.
**Status**: Inactive. Last contact July 19.

**ENTRY 008**
**Patient**: Verónica Talamantes García, age 45
**Occupation**: Retired schoolteacher, previously employed at Escuela Primaria Benito Juárez
**Date of intake**: July 20
**Presenting complaint**: Same dream architecture. Patient is the oldest subject to present with this complaint. She states that she first experienced the dream forty years ago, as a child, growing up in a colonia south of the river, and that it stopped when she was thirteen and resumed six months prior, exactly as it had been: the same corridors, the same copper, the same absence of windows. Forty years and the building had not changed. She says the building is "still being built. It is always still being built." She says she can now see construction materials that were not there in the childhood version — new walls, unpainted, still wet with something that might be plaster or might not be plaster.
**Somnographic findings**: Architecture frequency duration 12.8 minutes. The waveform now persists into Stage 2 sleep. It should not persist into Stage 2 sleep. I requested a second calibration check.
**Calibration report** (July 24): All equipment within manufacturer specifications.
**Status**: Missing persons report filed by nephew, Arturo Talamantes, on August 14 (Appendix C).

**ENTRY 009**
**Patient**: Rosalinda del Carmen Juárez, age 27
**Occupation**: Mother of three (children ages 2, 5, 7). No external employment.
**Date of intake**: August 3
**Presenting complaint**: The building. She brought her youngest child to the intake appointment. The child slept in a carrier on her chest while Rosalinda described the copper and the weight and the walls that breathe. She said she had not slept more than two consecutive hours in four months. She said the building was becoming more detailed each night — she could now see individual rooms, corridors, a basement level where something was humming.
**Somnographic findings**: Architecture frequency, 10.1 min. I note that the sub-harmonic component has increased in amplitude by a factor of three since Entry 006. The EEG preamplifier gain has not changed. The signal is growing from within.
**Status**: Inactive. The children are now with their grandmother in Chihuahua.

> *Nine women. I have begun keeping a separate log — not in this index, not in any file I submit to the Health Authority. A notebook, handwritten, in the bottom drawer next to Pilar's polysomnogram. The notebook contains the things I cannot write in clinical language: the fact that Yolanda Estrada worked the same shift at the same maquiladora as Luz Elena Acevedo and neither knew the other was dreaming the same dream. The fact that Amalia from the pharmacy stopped showing up to work three days before she stopped showing up to her follow-up and her employer did not report her missing because they hired a replacement the same afternoon. The fact that I have now filed seven cross-references to Appendix C and the Health Authority has asked me to stop filing them and I have not stopped.*

**ENTRY 010**
**Patient**: Sofía Reyes, age 18 (see note)
**Occupation**: Student
**Date of intake**: August 29
**Presenting complaint**: The building. The copper. She described the corridors as "wet." She sat in the intake chair with her knees drawn up and her arms wrapped around her shins and she looked like what she was, which was young, which was not eighteen. She said she had come because a girl from her school had told her about the clinic. I asked which girl. She said she could not remember the girl's name. She said the girl was not at school anymore.
**Somnographic findings**: Architecture frequency present. Duration 7.4 min. The waveform was otherwise unremarkable. I stared at the readout for a long time, looking for something different, something the younger brain might produce that the others had not. There was nothing different. The frequency does not care how old its host is. It takes the same shape in every skull it enters. It fits the same way. This is the most clinical observation I have made all year and it is the one that undid me.
**Note**: Patient presented identification listing her age as 18. Physical presentation and secondary indicators suggest patient may be younger. I did not verify. I admitted her to the study because I told myself the data was important. I told myself that the pattern required more data points and that age variance would strengthen the analysis. This is the language I used in my own head while I attached electrodes to the scalp of a child. I am recording this.
**Status**: File transferred to inactive after missed follow-up. No missing persons report has been filed. I do not know who would file one.

**ENTRY 011**
**Patient**: Angélica Bustamante Herrera, age 33
**Occupation**: Administrative assistant, Delegación Municipal de Transporte
**Date of intake**: September 10
**Presenting complaint**: Patient works in the same government complex as the Municipal Health Authority. She says she has been dreaming of a building that smells of copper and has no windows and contains the files of every woman who has ever gone missing in this city, and the files are not in cabinets — the files are in the walls, and the walls are made of files, and the building is made of women and the women are made of paper.

This is not a clinical transcription. This is what she said to me across a metal desk while the fluorescent light above us flickered and the traffic outside moved and the city continued to function as though none of this were happening. I wrote it down exactly as she spoke it because clinical language has begun to feel like an instrument of — like something that records the process of erasure rather than the fact of it.

**Somnographic findings**: Architecture frequency, 14.2 min. The waveform now occupies the entire REM period without interruption. The sub-harmonic has spawned a second sub-harmonic, 0.35 Hz, below the range of any known cortical oscillation, below the range of the equipment's published sensitivity floor, and yet the equipment records it. The machines are hearing something they were not built to hear.
**Status**: Appendix C.

**ENTRY 012**
**Patient**: Patricia Guzmán Flores, age 30
**Occupation**: Security guard, Centro Comercial Plaza del Sol
**Date of intake**: September 28
**Presenting complaint**: The building. Patricia said she patrols it. She said that in the dream she walks the corridors with a flashlight and the flashlight illuminates nothing because the walls produce their own light, a faint copper luminescence emanating from within the material, and she walks and walks and her shift never ends and the corridors multiply behind her as she passes through them, generating new hallways from the act of walking, so that the building grows in proportion to her movement through it, and if she stops walking the building stops growing but the women inside the walls continue to breathe and she can feel their breathing in her feet through the floor.
**Somnographic findings**: Architecture frequency. Paired peaks with triple echo. Sub-harmonics at 0.7 Hz and 0.35 Hz and now 0.17 Hz — each new patient adds a layer, halves the frequency, pushes the signal deeper into a register where it ceases to be measurable by the instruments that measure it and becomes instead something the instruments participate in, the way a wall participates in the room it encloses, the way a body participates in the sleep it cannot exit, the way a record participates in the disappearance it was supposed to prevent.
**Status**: Appendix C.

**ENTRY 013**
**Patient**: Magdalena Aguilar Soto, age 36
**Occupation**: Nurse, Hospital General del Norte
**Date of intake**: October 14
**Presenting complaint**: She came to the clinic because she recognized the somnographic printout. She is a nurse. She has seen EEGs. She pulled her own overnight recording from the hospital's sleep lab and saw the architecture frequency and came here and placed the printout on my desk and said, "You know what this is." I said yes. She said, "How many?" I said twelve before you. She said, "And how many came back?" And I said nothing because the answer to that question is the shape of this entire document, its actual geometry — not the numbers and dates and status lines but the white space between entries where the women should be and are not, the gap between "file transferred to inactive" and the truth, which is that they are gone and I have been writing their names in a format that makes their disappearance look like paperwork, like administrative routine, like something that can be indexed and filed and submitted by the fifteenth of December so that the year can close.
**Status**: Missing persons report filed by husband, Alejandro Soto, on November 1. Appendix C.

**INTER-OFFICE MEMORANDUM**
**From**: Dr. Lourdes Araya, Centro de Estudios del Sueño
**To**: Lic. Héctor Bonilla Preciado, Municipal Health Authority
**Date**: November 3
**Re**: Appendix C

I am in receipt of your directive dated October 20 requesting the removal of Appendix C from the Annual Case Index. I am unable to comply. Appendix C contains the only consolidated cross-reference between this clinic's patient records and the Ministerio Público's missing persons registry. If the appendix is removed, the correlation between somnographic presentation and subsequent disappearance ceases to be visible in any single document. This is precisely, I understand, the purpose of your request.

The appendix will remain.

> *I have started sleeping at the clinic. Not in the sleep lab — in my office, on the examination table, with the door locked. I tell myself it is because the commute is wasting time I need for the index. This is not true. I sleep at the clinic because when I sleep at the clinic I can hear the EEG machines running their calibration cycles in the empty lab next door, and the sound of the calibration cycles — that thin electronic hum, that cycling through frequencies — has begun to sound like breathing. Not my breathing. The machines' breathing. Or the building's breathing. There is no clinical language for what I mean. There is no clinical language for any of this anymore and there has not been for some time and the clinical language was never adequate and I used it anyway because it was all I had and because it was easier than writing what I actually observed, which is that these women came to me because they were being consumed and I recorded their consumption in the correct format and filed it on time.*

**ENTRY 014**
**Patient**: Renata Solís Quintero, age 28
**Occupation**: Seamstress (self-employed, home-based)
**Date of intake**: November 10
**Presenting complaint**: Patient states she has been dreaming of the Centro de Estudios del Sueño. Not a building *like* the clinic. The clinic itself: the waiting room with its green plastic chairs, the hallway with the cracked tile at the threshold of the sleep lab, the examination table where I am writing these notes. She describes the dream version of the clinic in detail I can verify — the water stain above the third window, the loose handle on the supply closet — but in her dream the clinic has no exits. The front door opens onto another hallway, which opens onto another waiting room, which opens onto another sleep lab, and in each lab there is a woman lying on a table with electrodes attached to her scalp, and the electrodes are not attached to the scalp, the electrodes are growing *out of* the scalp — thin silver filaments emerging from the skin like hair, like root structures, like something the body is producing from within rather than receiving from without, and each woman is asleep and each woman's monitor shows the same waveform, 14.2 Hz, angular peaks, paired, sub-harmonics descending into a register that is not a register but a place, a depth, a basement level beneath the floor of measurable signal where something is humming in a frequency the body knows but the mind does not, and the humming is the building, and the building is the women, and the women are the frequency, and the frequency is a door that only opens inward.

I recorded everything she said. I recorded it because recording is what I do. I recorded it and I knew while I was recording it that recording was the thing I did instead of the other thing, the thing that was not recording, and that the act of transcription had become a form of —

Renata asked me if I had been dreaming too. I told her yes. She asked me what I saw. I told her I saw a woman sitting at a desk, writing an index that never ended, in a building that was the index, in a city that was the building, and the woman could not stop writing because if she stopped writing the building would stop and if the building stopped the women inside it would — what? Wake up? Be found? Be acknowledged as missing by a system that requires their absence to remain legible only as data, as entries, as rows in a table submitted to the Health Authority by the fifteenth of December?

Renata held my hand across the examination table. Her fingers were calloused from needlework. She said, "Write this down too."

**Somnographic findings**: I did not run the polysomnogram. I disconnected the electrodes. I do not know if this changes anything. I do not know if the frequency requires the machines or if the machines require the frequency or if the distinction has collapsed. The equipment hummed all night in the empty lab. I checked the readout the next morning. It had recorded the architecture frequency for seven hours and forty-one minutes with no patient connected.
**Status**: Patient did not attend follow-up (November 24). Appendix C.

---

**ENTRY 015**
**Patient**: [Intake incomplete]
**Patient number**: 015
**Date**: December 2
**Note**: Patient arrived at 8:40 a.m. for a scheduled intake appointment. Patient was seated in the waiting room. At approximately 8:47 a.m. a dark-colored SUV, no license plates visible, stopped outside the clinic entrance. Two men in civilian clothing entered the waiting room. Neither spoke to the receptionist. They approached the patient, took her by both arms, and led her to the vehicle. The patient did not struggle. The patient did not speak. The receptionist did not speak. I observed from the window of my office. Duration of observation: fourteen seconds. The vehicle departed heading south on Avenida Independencia.

No further action taken.

> *Fourteen seconds. I watched for fourteen seconds and then I sat down and I wrote a note. I wrote a note because writing is what I do when women disappear. I write their name if I know their name and I did not know her name because she had not yet reached the intake desk. She was patient 015. She was a woman in a yellow blouse who sat in the third green chair from the door and did not come back and I did not go outside and I did not call anyone and I wrote this note. This is what I have done all year. This is what the index is. Not a record. A room I built around myself so I would not have to go outside.*

**ENTRY 016**
**Patient**: Lourdes Araya Montalvo, age 41
**Occupation**: Somnologist. Clinic director. The one with the pen.
**Date of intake**: December 12
**Referral**: Self-admitted
**Presenting complaint**: Recurring dream of compiling a document that does not end. The document is a building. The building has no windows. It smells of copper. Inside the building there are rooms and inside the rooms there are women and the women are asleep and the women are files and the files are walls and the walls are breathing with a frequency of 14.2 Hz and sub-harmonics at 0.7 and 0.35 and 0.17 and 0.08 and the frequency is descending, halving, approaching zero, approaching a silence that is not silence but a register so deep that only the body can hear it and the body hears it as architecture, as enclosure, as the weight of a building that has been under construction for as long as women have been disappearing in this city and will continue under construction for as long as women continue to disappear and the document I am compiling is a wing of this building, a corridor, a hallway lined with doors that open onto other hallways where other women sit at other desks compiling other indexes that are other corridors in the same building, and the building is the city, and the city is the document, and the document is the frequency, and the frequency is the women, and the women are gone.

**Somnographic findings**: I connected the electrodes to myself. I ran the study alone. I lay on the examination table in Lab 2 and closed my eyes and the last thing I heard before sleep was the hum of the calibration cycle, and the hum was 14.2 Hz, and it had always been 14.2 Hz, and the machines had not been recording the frequency — the machines had been transmitting it. Whether this is a clinical observation or a dream I cannot distinguish. The boundary dissolved somewhere between Entry 006 and Entry 011 and I did not mark the date because I was too busy indexing.
**Status**: See Appendix C.

**APPENDIX C: Cross-Reference — Patient Files / Missing Persons Registry, Ministerio Público**

*[The following appendix was requested for removal per Health Authority Directive 11-47, dated October 20. Removal denied by compiling clinician. See memorandum of November 3.]*

1. Isabel Carrizo Duarte, 22. Reported missing April 9 by Graciela Carrizo (mother). Last known address: Dormitorio Estudiantil, Universidad del Norte, Room 412. Status: Open.
2. Teresa Lucía Mondragón, 31. Reported missing May 27 by employer. Last known address: Calle Nogales 114, Colonia Obrera. Status: Open.

5. Luz Elena Acevedo Parra, 24. Reported missing August 1 by sister, Carolina Acevedo Parra. Last known address: Calle Durango 28, Colonia Revolución. Carolina called the clinic on August 3 and asked if her sister had attended her last appointment. I checked the file. The last appointment had been July 19. I told Carolina that her sister had not attended. Carolina said, "She told me she was going to the sleep place. She said it was helping." I did not tell Carolina that her sister's brain had been producing a frequency that I could not explain and could not stop and could not even name except privately. I told Carolina to contact the Ministerio Público. Status: Open.
6. Verónica Talamantes García, 45. Reported missing August 14 by Arturo Talamantes (nephew). Last known address: Privada de los Pinos 7. Status: Open.
7. Rosalinda del Carmen Juárez, 27. Reported missing September 2 by mother-in-law. Children placed with maternal grandmother in Chihuahua. Last known address: Calle Libertad 203. The two-year-old's name is Emilia. I know this because Rosalinda told me during intake while Emilia slept against her chest. I am writing the child's name here because someone should. Status: Open.
8. Sofía Reyes, age unknown. No report filed. No known family contact. No known address. She came from nowhere that I documented and returned to nowhere that I documented and the space between those two nowheres is the space where the investigation would be if there were an investigation. Status: No investigation.
9. Angélica Bustamante Herrera, 33. Reported missing October 8 by coworker. Last known address: Departamento 6B, Edificio Revolución, Av. Tecnológico. Status: Open.
10. Patricia Guzmán Flores, 30. Reported missing October 22 by mother. Last known address: Calle Juárez 88, Colonia Centro. Status: Open.
11. Magdalena Aguilar Soto, 36. Reported missing November 1 by Alejandro Soto (husband). Last known address: Calle de los Doctores 15. Status: Open.
12. Renata Solís Quintero, 28. No report filed. Self-employed. Last known address: unknown. Status: No investigation.
13. Patient 015, name unknown. No report filed. Physical description: female, approximately 30-35 years of age, yellow blouse, dark hair to the shoulders. Last seen December 2 at 8:47 a.m. in the waiting room of the Centro de Estudios del Sueño. Status: No investigation. No name. No investigation.

*[Entries 14 and 15 below added December 12]*

14. Yolanda Estrada Ruiz, 29. No report filed in this jurisdiction. Last known address: housing block administered by Maquiladora Tectrón. I am adding her now because I should have added her first, because she was Entry 001, because she stopped attending follow-up in February and I marked her file inactive and did not cross-reference, did not check, did not walk three blocks to the Tectrón housing block and knock on her door. Yolanda. Her name was first in the index and it should have been first here and it was not because in February I still believed that the document was separate from what the document described.
15. Dolores Fernández Ibarra, 34. No report filed. Referred by primary care. Domestic worker. She told me the walls of the dream were warm like skin and I wrote it in clinical notation and transferred her file to inactive, which is a word that means gone, which is a word that means the system has finished with her, which is a word I have been using all year in place of the word that means what actually happened.
