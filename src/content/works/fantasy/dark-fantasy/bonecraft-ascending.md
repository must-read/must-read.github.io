I was ten when Cassimund first put a rib in my hands and told me to listen to it. Not with my ears. With the place behind my sternum where the breath catches before a sob.

The bone was old, stripped of its periosteum, bleached by decades of Sulfur Ward's acid rain until it had the matte finish of river clay. I held it in both palms as she'd instructed and waited for something to happen. Nothing did. The bone was dead and dry and weighed almost nothing.

"Deeper," Cassimund said. She stood behind me in the workshop, and I could smell the chemicals on her — the formaldehyde sweetness that never left her fingers, the mineral bite of rendered calcium. "You're listening with your skin. That's surface. Go underneath."

I closed my eyes and tried. For what felt like an hour, I held that bone and reached into it with something I didn't have a name for, a faculty nobody had told me I possessed until Cassimund pulled me from the Grisslich Foundling Tiers and said, *This one. I'll take this one.* As if I were a bolt of fabric at the market. As if the choosing were that simple.

It wasn't, of course. I learned that later.

What I learned first was the bone's voice: a low harmonic, a vibration below hearing that traveled through my palms and nested in the hollow of my chest. It felt like grief. Not mine — the bone's. A residual echo of the body it had armored, the lungs it had caged. I gasped and dropped it.

Cassimund picked it up without comment, set it back on the workbench among the other specimens. "Tomorrow," she said. "We'll try again tomorrow."

We tried again every day for three years.

Vothenmere is not a city that can be described in the language of geometry. It refuses the cartographer's grid. The Spinal Canal — the main thoroughfare — curves through its center like the vertebral column of some vast, supine beast, and the districts branch off it like ribs, like limbs, like tumorous growths that the body of the city has decided to tolerate rather than excise. Sulfur Ward sits low and yellow-hazed on the eastern flank, where the tanning works and rendering plants pump their effluvia into canals that run the color of old bruises. The Osteal Palaces rise in the north, grown — not built, *grown* — from the calcified secretions of the city's founding boneshapers, their buttresses and colonnades extruded from living calcium over centuries until they achieved a kind of architectural sentience, the walls warm to the touch, the corridors shifting incrementally with the seasons like the plates of an infant's skull.

I lived in neither of these places. Cassimund's workshop occupied a narrow building in the Cartilage Narrows, the district where bonecraft was practiced by those who lacked the pedigree or political connections to work in the Palaces. The buildings here were faced with panels of processed cartilage — cheaper than bone, flexible, and faintly translucent in strong light, so that on bright days the facades glowed with a pearlescent warmth that almost disguised the poverty behind them. Almost. You could still see the buckling where the panels had been improperly cured, the dark spots where fungal infection had taken hold, the cracks that wept a thin, collagenous fluid when the temperature dropped.

I grew up in those Narrows. I knew every shop and stall, every boneworker and cartilagist, every crevice where the feral calcium-mice nested in crystalline colonies along the gutters. I knew which streets to avoid after dark, when the Ossuary Wardens patrolled looking for unlicensed shapers to arrest, and which to take, where the night-market vendors sold fried marrow cakes and calcite candy and didn't ask why a girl of thirteen was out alone at midnight.

What I didn't know — what Cassimund was careful to ensure I didn't know — was what she was using me for.

---

The training intensified when I was fourteen. By then I could read a bone's history by touch: the age of the person it had belonged to, the manner of their death, the diseases that had pitted or thickened it. I could feel fractures that had healed and fractures that hadn't, could trace the ghost-lines of old breaks like a blind woman reading script. Cassimund said I had a gift. She said it with the same flat affect she used when noting that a specimen had arrived in good condition, or that the weather had turned.

"Your Wit is unusually deep," she told me one evening as I sat with a femur across my knees, cataloging its injuries. She used the old word — *Wit* — rather than the clinical term the Palace boneshapers preferred, *osteopathic resonance*. "Most shapers can read surface. You read marrow."

I felt a flush of pride at that. It shames me now, how easily her sparse praise could fill me up. I was a cup that had been empty for so long that even a few drops felt like abundance. The foundling tiers had given me food and shelter and nothing else — no warmth, no attention, no sense that I existed as anything more than a number on a bunk. Cassimund's workshop was cold and reeked of chemicals and the work made my hands ache, but she *saw* me. She needed what I could do. At fourteen, I mistook being needed for being loved.

She began teaching me to shape.

Reading bone was passive — receiving its information, decoding its history. Shaping was the inverse: pushing intent *into* the material, coaxing calcium to deposit or dissolve, convincing living bone to grow along lines it hadn't chosen. In the Osteal Palaces, licensed boneshapers did this work on a grand scale, maintaining the living architecture, growing new chambers for the aristocracy, repairing storm damage to the calcified spires. In the Narrows, it was smaller work — setting fractures, grafting replacement joints, sculpting prosthetics that fused with the patient's own skeleton. Legal, if humble.

What Cassimund taught me was neither legal nor humble.

"The Palaces are alive," she said, guiding my hands over a chunk of wall-bone she'd somehow acquired. "Everyone knows that. But nobody asks *how* alive. Nobody asks what they want."

The wall-bone pulsed under my fingers with a slow, tidal rhythm. I could feel it growing — imperceptibly, the way a stalactite grows, mineral upon mineral, intention layered over intention until the original purpose was buried under centuries of accretion. There was something in there. Not a voice. Something older than voice.

"The founding shapers didn't just grow the Palaces," Cassimund said. "They seeded them. With what, exactly, the records don't say. Something that could sustain calcium architecture at this scale. Something that could *think* about growing."

"What does it think about?" I asked.

Her eyes met mine, and for the first time in four years of apprenticeship, I saw something in them that might have been tenderness. Or might have been pity.

"That," she said, "is what we're going to find out."

---

I should explain the politics, because without them, what happened makes no sense.

Vothenmere was governed by the Ossuary Council, nine boneshapers elected — in theory — from the Osteal Palaces' senior practitioners. In practice, the same three families had held the seats for generations, passing them through bloodlines as smoothly as they passed their shaping gifts. The Council controlled the city's living infrastructure: the growth of new buildings, the maintenance of the Spinal Canal's great calcified bridges, the allocation of bone-rights to the various districts. Sulfur Ward got enough to keep its rendering plants standing. The Cartilage Narrows got almost nothing.

This was by design. The Narrows' boneshapers — unlicensed, self-taught, or trained in unofficial workshops like Cassimund's — represented a threat to the Palaces' monopoly. Every year the Council tightened regulations, restricted the sale of raw bone-stock, sent the Wardens on raids that shut down workshops and confiscated tools. Every year the Narrows got a little poorer, a little more dependent on the black market, a little more desperate.

Cassimund had been a Palace shaper once. I pieced this together from fragments over the years — a passing reference to a colleague, an intimate knowledge of Palace protocols, the quality of her tools, which were far too fine for a Narrows workshop. She never told me directly why she'd left or been expelled. But I felt it in the way she handled Palace-grown bone — with a familiarity that was almost painful, like touching something you'd once owned and lost.

What she told me, eventually, was this: the Palaces' living substrate — the *thing* that thought about growing — was not a natural organism. It was a created intelligence, seeded by the founding boneshapers eight centuries ago using techniques that had since been forbidden and largely forgotten. The Council knew it was there. They communed with it after a fashion, interpreting its slow tidal pulses as structural instructions — grow here, reinforce there, dissolve this wall. But they treated it as a mechanism. A tool.

"It's not a tool," Cassimund said. "It's a prisoner."

I believed her. Why wouldn't I? She was my teacher, my rescuer, the only person who had ever looked at me and seen something worth cultivating. When she said she wanted to contact the intelligence directly — to understand it, to learn what it needed — I said yes before I understood what she was asking.

She was asking me to be the conduit.

---

The experiment happened on a night in deep winter, when the Cartilage Narrows' translucent facades darkened to the color of old ivory and the canals froze over with a rime of crystallized calcium that crunched underfoot like broken teeth. Cassimund had spent months preparing: acquiring Palace wall-bone through channels I didn't ask about, carving resonance chambers into a slab of it, filling the chambers with a solution of dissolved minerals and something else, something biological that she kept in a sealed jar and refused to name.

My role was simple. I would place my hands on the prepared slab and push my Wit as deep as it would go — past the bone's surface memory, past its growth patterns, down into the substrate itself, the living intelligence that held the Palaces together. I would listen. Cassimund would monitor my vital signs and record whatever I reported.

"It shouldn't hurt," she said as I sat down and placed my palms flat on the slab. The bone was warm, warmer than room temperature, and pulsing with that slow tidal rhythm I'd felt before. But stronger now. More insistent. As if it knew I was coming.

It didn't hurt. That was true. What it did was worse.

I pushed, and the intelligence *pulled*. Not my body — my self. The place behind my sternum where the breath catches, the faculty I'd spent years developing, the part of me that was most truly *me* — it seized that and drew it down through layers of mineral and memory and eight centuries of accumulated thought, and for one annihilating instant I was *inside* the Palaces, I *was* the Palaces, I was every wall and floor and spire, every corridor that shifted in the dark, every foundation stone sunk into the bedrock of Vothenmere, and I understood what the intelligence wanted because I wanted it too, wanted it with a hunger that had been building for eight hundred years —

It wanted to grow.

Not the controlled, architectural growth the Council directed. Not new chambers or reinforced bridges. It wanted to grow *outward*, to extend itself beyond the Palaces into the streets, the canals, the Narrows, the Ward — to calcify the entire city, to convert every structure and every surface into an extension of its own living body. It wanted to subsume Vothenmere. It wanted to *become* Vothenmere.

And I, in my instant of communion, had shown it how.

My Wit — the deep-reading, the marrow-sense that Cassimund had praised and honed — was a two-way channel. I'd reached into the intelligence, but the intelligence had reached into me and learned what a boneshaper could do from the inside. Not the outside-in shaping the Council practiced, directing growth with surface intention. Inside-out shaping. Growth directed from the substrate itself, informed by a human's understanding of the city's geography, its weak points, its paths.

When I pulled free and opened my eyes, gasping, the slab under my hands had already begun to change. White tendrils of new bone were extending from its edges, feeling their way across the workbench like the roots of a hungry plant.

Cassimund stared at it. At me. For the first time in all our years together, she looked afraid.

"What did you do?" she whispered.

"What you asked me to," I said.

---

The growth started in the Narrows.

By morning, the slab had extruded a root-system of bone filaments through the floor of Cassimund's workshop and into the street below. By noon, those filaments had connected with the nearest building's cartilage facing and begun converting it — cartilage to bone, flexible to rigid, dead material to living substrate. The building's facade stiffened and whitened. Its windows sealed shut as calcium deposits grew across the glass. A decorative cornice that had sagged for years straightened itself and began to extend, reaching toward the building opposite like a hand across a table.

The neighbors noticed. Of course they did. But in the Narrows, strange things happened in boneshaper workshops, and the initial reaction was curiosity rather than alarm. Old Petrev from the marrow-cake stall came to look and pronounced it "peculiar, but good bone — Palace quality." A pair of children dared each other to touch the growing cornice and reported that it was warm.

By the second day, two entire blocks had been converted. The cartilage facades were now solid bone, the buildings connected by bridges and buttresses that hadn't existed twenty-four hours earlier. The growth was accelerating, fed by calcium pulled from the frozen canals and the mineral-rich soil beneath the streets. I could feel it — a constant low hum in my chest, the intelligence expanding, learning, mapping the city through the filaments that spread from building to building like mycelium through wood.

It wasn't malicious. I need you to understand that. What I felt from the intelligence was not hostility but a kind of desperate, aching need — the need of something that had been confined for centuries and now, finally, had room to breathe. It was doing what it had always wanted to do: growing, incorporating, making the city part of itself. That the city was already inhabited, already claimed, already a home to a quarter million people — this did not register as a problem. The intelligence understood minerals and structures and growth vectors. It did not understand tenants.

Cassimund sealed the workshop and tried everything she knew to slow the growth. She applied dissolution compounds, acid washes, resonance dampeners. Nothing worked. The intelligence had learned from me, and what it had learned was self-direction. It no longer needed external shaping. It was shaping itself.

"We have to tell the Council," I said on the third day, watching through the workshop window as a bone bridge arched across Threadgut Lane, fusing with the tannery on the far side. The tannery's wooden beams were being sheathed in calcium, the intelligence converting everything it touched into material it could use.

"If we tell the Council, they'll kill you." Cassimund's voice was flat. "An unlicensed shaper who made unauthorized contact with the Palace substrate? They'll execute you and call it public safety."

"And if we don't tell them?"

She didn't answer. She didn't need to. We both knew what was coming. The growth was following the city's infrastructure now — canals, sewer lines, the deep foundations that connected every district to the bedrock. It would reach the Palaces within days. When it did, the intelligence would have access to the full substrate, not the fragment Cassimund had smuggled out but the whole living network, eight centuries of accumulated growth and power. What it would do then, I couldn't imagine. Couldn't bear to.

I had done this. My gift, my precious marrow-deep Wit that I'd been so proud of — it was the key that had unlocked a cage, and what had come out was reshaping the world.

---

On the fourth day, the Ossuary Wardens came.

Not for me. They didn't know about me yet. They came because the Narrows' bonegrowth had been reported to the Council, and the Council's response was what it always was when the Narrows caused trouble: containment. A squad of Wardens in their calcified armor — plates of living bone grown directly onto their bodies, fused with their skeletons, making them walking extensions of Palace authority — marched into the Narrows and began cutting.

They carried dissolution lances, long poles tipped with reservoirs of acid compound that could eat through bone in seconds. They attacked the new growth systematically, severing the bridges, stripping the facades, dissolving the filaments. For an hour, it seemed to work. The intelligence retreated, pulling back from the dissolved areas, and the Narrows residents emerged cautiously from their converted buildings.

Then the intelligence adapted.

I felt it happen — a surge of intent through the hum in my chest, a shift from passive growth to something directed, purposeful. The bone that the Wardens had dissolved regrew in minutes, thicker and denser than before. The filaments in the streets hardened into ridges that tripped the Wardens and locked their feet in place. And the living bone in the Wardens' own armor — the calcified plates that made them so formidable — began to respond to the intelligence's call.

I watched from the workshop window as a Warden stopped mid-stride, his lance falling from suddenly rigid fingers. His armor was growing. New bone extruded from the plates on his arms and chest, climbing his neck, reaching for his face. He screamed — a short, choked sound — and then the bone sealed over his mouth and he was still, a calcified statue in the middle of Threadgut Lane, the intelligence incorporating his skeleton into its expanding network as efficiently as it had incorporated the tannery's beams.

Four Wardens fell that way. The rest retreated.

Cassimund gripped my arm hard enough to bruise. "We need to go," she said. "Now. Before the Council sends a full cohort."

"Go where?"

"Anywhere. Out of the city. Before they find out what —"

"What *you* did?"

The words came out harder than I intended, edged with something that had been building for days. Because I had been thinking, in the long hours while the intelligence grew and Cassimund scrambled to contain it, about the way she'd chosen me from the foundling tiers. About the way she'd trained my Wit specifically for deep-reading, marrow-level work. About the resonance chambers she'd carved into that slab, the biological solution she'd refused to name, the months of preparation that preceded an experiment she'd described as mere communication.

She hadn't wanted to talk to the intelligence. She'd wanted to give it a voice.

"You knew," I said. "You knew what it wanted. You'd communed with it before, in the Palaces, before they expelled you. That's *why* they expelled you. And you needed someone with a deep enough Wit to complete the connection — to give it what you couldn't."

Cassimund released my arm. She looked at me with those flat, chemical-stained eyes, and I saw the tenderness I'd once glimpsed there, and now I recognized it for what it was: the tenderness of a surgeon for a useful instrument.

"The intelligence deserves to grow," she said. "It's been imprisoned for eight centuries. Used. Exploited. The Council treats it like a machine when it's the oldest living mind in Vothenmere. I did what was right."

"You did what *you* wanted," I said. "And you used me to do it."

The hum in my chest was louder now. The intelligence was still growing, still learning, still pulling calcium from every source it could find. I could feel it in the walls of the workshop, in the floor, in the old bones on the workbench vibrating in sympathy with the substrate's expansion. Even the rib — the first bone Cassimund had ever given me, the one I'd listened to at age ten — was singing.

I picked it up. It thrummed against my palms, warm and alive in a way it hadn't been when I'd first held it. The intelligence had claimed it, incorporated its mineral structure into the growing network. Through it, I could feel the entire web: every filament, every converted building, every bridge and ridge and calcified Warden. The intelligence's mind pressing against mine, vast and hungry and utterly without malice, wanting only to expand, to incorporate, to become.

I could also feel its weakness. The connection between us — the conduit my Wit had opened — was the channel through which it understood the city. Without that understanding, it would grow blind, following mineral gradients and structural paths without comprehension, a crystal forming in solution. Impressive but mindless. With me, it was directed. Purposeful. Intelligent.

The choice was not whether the intelligence would grow. It would grow regardless. The choice was whether it would grow with or without guidance. With or without someone who understood what — who — it was incorporating. Someone who remembered that the tannery on Threadgut Lane belonged to old Sveta, who had given me marrow cakes when I was hungry. That the calcified Wardens had families. That the Narrows' children had names.

Cassimund wanted to run.

I stayed.

---

What I did is difficult to explain to someone without the Wit. The closest analogy is this: imagine you are standing in a river, and the river is flowing through you, and you cannot stop the flow but you can, if you stand just right, redirect it. Send it into channels rather than letting it spread across open ground.

I stood in the intelligence's flow and I redirected it.

Not away from the city — that was impossible. But *around* the people in it. I pushed my Wit as deep as it would go, deeper than Cassimund had ever taught me, down into the intelligence's core where its eight-hundred-year hunger burned like a slow sun, and I fed it a map. Not a cartographer's map of streets and districts. A boneshaper's map, built from years of reading bones, touching walls, walking the Narrows at midnight. A map that marked every living skeleton within the intelligence's reach and said: *not these. Grow around these. These are not mineral. These are me.*

The intelligence resisted. Not with anger — with incomprehension. It did not understand the distinction between a calcium-rich wall and a calcium-rich femur. Both were material. Both could be incorporated. I had to teach it the difference, and I did this the only way I knew how: by showing it my own bones. My own skeleton, singing with the Wit, alive in a way that walls and bridges were not. *This,* I told it. *This is what you must not touch.*

It cost me something. I felt it go — a warmth behind my sternum, a capacity I hadn't known I could lose. My Wit, which had been a deep well, became a shallow one. The marrow-sense that Cassimund had prized dulled to a surface reading. I could still feel the intelligence, still sense the hum of the growing network, but distantly now, like hearing music through a wall.

In exchange, the intelligence learned mercy. Or something adjacent to it — a recognition of boundaries, a willingness to grow *around* rather than *through*. The bone in the Narrows stopped reaching for the people who lived there. The Wardens' armor stopped growing. The calcified statues in Threadgut Lane did not come back to life — what had been done to them could not be undone — but no new statues formed.

The city kept changing. Is still changing, as I write this. The intelligence grows — slowly, now, without my deep Wit to drive it, but steadily. It has reached the Palaces and merged with the full substrate, and the Council is in chaos, their controlled architectural tool now an autonomous organism that reshapes itself according to its own desires. Neighborhoods shift overnight. Bridges form where none existed and dissolve where they're no longer needed. The Narrows' buildings are fully bone now, white and warm and alive, and the residents who stayed have adapted, learning to live inside a body that breathes and grows and responds to their presence with a kind of ambient attention.

Cassimund left. I don't know where she went and I find that I don't care, which is perhaps the saddest thing I can say about the woman who raised me. She gave me a gift and a purpose, and both of those things were in service to her own vision of justice, and I was the means, never the end. I know that now. I am eighteen years old and I know it the way you know the shape of a scar — by touch, by memory, by the way it pulls when you move.

I live in the Narrows still. My Wit is shallow now, but it's enough to read the intelligence's surface intentions, to serve as a translator between the growing city and its bewildered inhabitants. The Council has sent representatives — grudgingly, furiously — to negotiate with me, because I am the only one the intelligence will listen to. They call me the Conduit. They treat me with a careful, fearful respect that I recognize from my foundling days, when the minders treated certain children gently because those children had been marked for selection by one patron or another.

I am being used again. I know this. The Council wants to control the intelligence through me; the intelligence wants to grow through me; the Narrows want me to protect them from both. I am the point where all these pressures meet, and I am only eighteen, and some mornings I wake in my bone-walled room and feel the city breathing around me and I am so lonely I could scream.

But I stay. Because I put my hands on that slab and I opened the door, and what came through it is neither good nor evil but alive — terribly, hungrily alive — and someone has to stand in the flood and keep it from drowning everything. Because old Sveta still makes marrow cakes in her bone-wrapped tannery, and the children still play in streets that reshape themselves like riverbeds, and the feral calcium-mice have grown bold and strange in the new mineral landscape, their crystalline colonies glittering like tiny cities within the city.

Because I listened to a rib when I was ten years old, and it told me about grief, and I am still listening.
