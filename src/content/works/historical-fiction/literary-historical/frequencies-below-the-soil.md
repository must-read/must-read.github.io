formulaSummary: >
  Whitehead's flat, self-interrogating prose — the body under systemic violence
  recorded without sentimentality — alternates with Doerr's luminous sensory
  attention to the physical world. The telegraph wire replaces the underground
  railroad as dual-use infrastructure: carrying warrants and warnings on the same
  copper. Two lives vibrate at the same frequency across three hundred miles of
  Ohio, connected by wire and the theme of sympathetic resonance, and never meet.
synopsis: >
  In 1853 Ohio, a Black telegraph operator in Cincinnati transmits a fugitive
  slave warrant before he can read it, then must decide whether to send a warning.
  Three hundred miles away, the woman described in the warrant washes linen and
  keeps her shoes by the bed.
combination:
  fromAuthorA:
    - Dry, self-interrogating prose in Elias's chapters — the mind dissecting its own complicity while the body acts without permission
    - The warrant rendered as inventory language — a human being described as lost property, horror residing in the bureaucratic form
    - Flat declarative sentences that refuse to mourn, trusting the reader to supply the emotional register
  fromAuthorB:
    - Luminous sensory detail in Rue's chapters — lye soap, evening light, the texture of mended cotton, foxfire's blue-green glow
    - Short chapters as mosaic tiles — meaning assembled from juxtaposition, not narration
    - The physical world rendered with scientific precision that becomes emotional argument
  fromWorkX:
    - The journey toward freedom inverted — Rue runs south, back into the geography she escaped, for a reason the system cannot compute
    - American geography as infrastructure of capture — the telegraph wire replacing the railroad as a network carrying both law and resistance
    - The body in hostile terrain, survival as physical fact rather than metaphor
  fromWorkY:
    - Dual narratives connected by invisible network — two lives that never intersect but vibrate at the same frequency
    - The telegraph operator as the novel's Werner — technical skill instrumentalized by a system he cannot fully resist
    - Sensory richness as resistance — beauty not decorative but constitutive of the will to continue

## 5:47 AM, Cincinnati Relay

The cotton report came first. New Orleans to Cleveland, priority commercial, the prices steady at eleven and three-quarter cents per pound for middling uplands. Elias's fingers translated without consulting him. The sounder clicked its small iron tongue against the brass anvil and his right hand moved on the key in response and the message traveled north through the wire at something close to the speed of light, which was to say instantaneously, which was to say before he could form an opinion about it.

He had been at the relay desk since five. The office smelled of lamp oil and the particular staleness of a room that is never fully aired. His coffee had gone cold in the tin cup. Outside, Third Street was still dark, though the sky over Kentucky had begun to gray in a way that was less sunrise than the withdrawal of night, as if darkness were a liquid slowly draining from the east.

The priority line interrupted.

Dah-dit, dah-dit-dit, dit-dah. He transcribed automatically, his pencil catching the characters before they assembled into words. The Morse came fast, a Cincinnati operator he did not recognize — new, or borrowed from another office. His hand wrote: FUGITIVE. SLAVE. WARRANT. PURSUANT TO ACT OF SEPTEMBER 18, 1850. FEMALE. ESCAPED PROPERTY OF. Then a name he wrote and did not read. HEIGHT FIVE FEET FOUR INCHES. SCAR LEFT FOREARM WRIST TO ELBOW FROM BURN. DARK COMPLEXION. AGE TWENTY-FOUR TO TWENTY-EIGHT. LAST KNOWN VICINITY OBERLIN LORAIN COUNTY OHIO. REWARD.

The amount. He wrote the amount.

He had already retransmitted the message to the Cleveland relay before he set down his pencil and read what his hand had written. A woman's body, described the way you would describe a horse gone missing from a stable: height, markings, last seen. The scar from wrist to elbow. He thought about burns and what size of burn leaves a scar that long on an arm that short, and then he stopped thinking about it.

The galena crystal sat on the edge of his desk, where it had sat for two years — a rough gray lump of lead sulfide from Josiah's lecture on electrical conductivity. A mineral that converts invisible signal into audible sound. The material principle of the telegraph itself, made solid, kept as a paperweight. Elias picked it up. It was cold and heavier than it looked. He held it in his palm and felt nothing, because it was a rock, and rocks do not feel, and that was the whole of its appeal.

## Lye

On Tuesday mornings Rue carried the Griffiths' laundry down to the creek behind the cooper's lot, where the water ran clear over flat stones and the bank was low enough to kneel without muddying her skirt above the knee. She had learned this in the first month: keep the skirt dry, because the Griffiths noticed stains on a laundress the way they noticed stains on their linen, and both raised the same question of competence.

The lye soap she made herself from ash and tallow. It smelled of nothing clean — of rendered fat, of fire's remainder, of the particular alkaline sharpness that stripped grease from cotton and skin from knuckles in equal measure. She worked the soap into the collar of Ezra Griffith's Sunday shirt, where the sweat had yellowed the cloth to the color of old piano keys, and the cold creek water turned her fingers the red of boiled shrimp. The knuckle of her right index finger had cracked open again, the skin split along the same fault line it split every March, when the air was dry enough to parch and the water cold enough to punish, and a thin line of blood ran into the lather and disappeared, pink into white, gone.

A kingfisher sat on a low branch across the creek, blue-gray and still as a carved thing, watching the water with the focus of someone who has been told the answer is there. Rue watched it watching. The bird did not care that she was kneeling three yards away with a white man's shirt in her hands. The bird had an entire theory of the creek that did not include her, and she found this comforting.

She wrung the shirt and laid it across the flat stone to beat. The thwack of wet linen on rock traveled across the water and came back to her a half-second later, a faint echo off the cooper's barn wall. Sound going out and coming back changed. She did not think about this. She beat the shirt and listened to the echo and her hands were steady and the morning was cold and the work was work and it was hers.

The second shirt was the wife's — lighter cotton, a summer blouse that should have been stored but had been worn through fall and into winter because Mrs. Griffith was not careful with her things, which was a privilege Rue recognized without naming: the luxury of treating cloth as disposable, of wearing a garment past its season because another could be bought. Rue scrubbed the cuffs where the ink had set from Mrs. Griffith's letter-writing and the soap raised a faint purple ghost from the fibers, not removing the stain but spreading it, distributing the evidence of one woman's correspondence across the entire sleeve. She would have to boil it. She noted this without irritation. The work had steps and the steps had order and the order was hers to determine, which was the whole of her freedom on a Tuesday morning, and it was enough, and it was not enough, and both of these things were true without canceling each other.

## The Galena

Every mineral has a crystalline structure, and that structure determines what passes through it. Josiah had explained this during the third week of Elias's training, holding a piece of galena up to the lamp so the cubic planes caught the light. Some crystals permit the passage of current in one direction only. A gatekeeper at the level of the atom. The telegraph depends on this asymmetry — signal must flow forward, not backward, or the entire system becomes noise.

Elias had not thought about Josiah in eleven days, which was five days longer than the previous record. He kept count. The counting was not penance; it was measurement. He was interested in whether the interval would continue to lengthen, whether forgetting followed a curve or a line, whether there was a mathematical function that described the rate at which a man stops thinking about the man he betrayed.

The warrant he had transmitted that morning was, by afternoon, already paper. Somewhere in Cleveland a marshal or a commissioner's clerk was reading the physical copy, and the words had become ink, and the ink had become law, and the law would become a man on a horse riding toward Oberlin with a description of a woman's body in his pocket. Elias had not put the man on the horse. He had only moved the information from one wire to another. The distinction was clear. It was the kind of distinction that required no effort to maintain, which was how he knew it was false.

## Parallelogram

The room cost her seventy-five cents a week, paid to Mrs. Gale, who owned the house on East College Street and rented three rooms to single women of color who could provide a church reference. The room was ten feet by twelve. Rue had measured it with a length of twine her second night, not because she needed to know the dimensions but because measuring was a way of claiming — her hands on every wall, her knots marking the distances, the twine coiled afterward and kept in the drawer with her comb and her only letter, which was not a letter but a free paper, forged, that said she was born in Zanesville, Ohio, and had never been property.

In the evenings the light came through the single west-facing window and made a shape on the floor. A parallelogram. It entered at four o'clock in October, four-thirty in November, and by December it barely appeared at all before the sun dropped behind the roofline of the meetinghouse. Now, in March, it arrived at quarter to five and stretched itself across the floorboards like a cat finding the warm spot, and Rue stepped around it the way she would step around a cat — not wanting to disturb something that had chosen its place.

She ate her supper in the parallelogram's company. Bread and cold pork and a boiled egg she had been given by the Griffiths' cook, who was kind in the way of people who are kind when it costs them nothing, which is still kindness, Rue had decided, and she would take it. The egg was still faintly warm. She held it in her palm and felt the warmth fade, the life of the kitchen passing out of the shell and into the air of her room, and she ate it in three bites and the yolk was dry and chalky at the center, the way she preferred, because a runny yolk reminded her of things she did not choose to remember.

She washed her plate in the basin. She hung her apron on the hook. She checked that her shoes were beside the bed, laces loosened, tongues folded back, ready to step into without bending down. She had done this every night for twenty-three months. It was not fear. It was the maintenance of a capability. The way a man might keep a rifle cleaned and oiled without expecting to fire it. The shoes sat with their mouths open and the parallelogram shrank toward the wall and the room grew dark by degrees and Rue lay on the bed in her clothes and closed her eyes and the quiet was the quiet of a held breath, and she held it, and she slept.

## Resistance (Ohms)

The wire between Cincinnati and Cleveland was four hundred and twelve miles of drawn copper strung on chestnut poles, and every mile introduced resistance. Resistance was the friction of the signal against the medium, the message losing itself in the act of travel. By the time a transmission reached Cleveland, it had been attenuated — diminished by the physical fact of distance, the same message but less of it, the way a shout loses volume crossing a field.

Elias understood resistance as a professional concern. He calibrated his instruments to compensate for it. He adjusted the battery strength, the spring tension on the sounder, the sensitivity of the relay magnets. His job was to ensure that the message arriving in Cleveland was identical to the message leaving Cincinnati, that distance did not degrade the signal, that the wire carried everything equally.

The wire carried cotton prices and bank transfers and weather reports from the lake. It carried personal messages — births, deaths, arrivals, delays. It carried commercial traffic and government dispatches and, since September of 1850, it carried warrants for the recovery of human property. The wire did not distinguish. Copper has no opinion. The current flows or it does not, and the message is the message, and Elias was the relay, and the relay does not interpret.

He had explained this to himself four hundred times. The number was not approximate.

## The Scar

The scar on Rue's left forearm ran from wrist to elbow, a raised ridge of tissue the color of dark plum, darker than the skin on either side of it. She had received it at fourteen, not from punishment but from labor — a kettle of boiling water for the wash, tipped by a gust of wind or by her own fatigue or by the intervention of a God she had since stopped crediting with interest in her body's welfare. The water had sheeted down her arm and the pain had been so absolute that she remembered it not as a sensation but as a sound, a high white ringing that replaced every other perception for what felt like minutes but was probably seconds.

The overseer's wife had dressed the wound with lard and a strip of torn petticoat. The lard was rancid and the petticoat was not clean, and the burn had healed badly, scarring thick and ropy, and the scar had become, in the years since, the most distinctive thing about her body — more notable than her face, which was ordinary, or her height, which was average, or her hands, which were the hands of any woman who washed things for other people. The scar was what the warrant described. The scar was what the marshals would look for. The scar was the signature her body had written without her permission, and she could not revise it, and she wore long sleeves in every season, and the long sleeves were themselves a kind of signature, because who wears long sleeves in an Ohio July except a woman hiding a scar that describes her to the law.

She had thought, in the early months in Oberlin, about cutting the scar. Reopening the wound and letting it heal differently, flatter, less distinctive. She had held the knife. She had pressed the blade against the ridge of tissue and felt the steel's coldness and the scar's numbness — the burned skin had no feeling, as if the nerve endings beneath it had decided that they had felt enough and would feel no more. She had not cut. Not because of courage or cowardice but because the scar was the record of a thing that had happened to her body, and to erase the record felt like agreeing with the warrant that her body was not hers, that it could be revised to serve someone else's purpose, that the history written in her skin was subject to editorial correction.

She kept the scar. She kept the long sleeves. She kept the knowledge that the most visible part of her was also the most dangerous.

## Horses

The sound of hooves on the Oberlin road was a common sound. Farmers came and went. The college brought visitors. A horse was a horse was a horse, and Rue knew this, and her hands shook anyway.

She was hanging the Widows' linens on the line behind the church — three sets of sheets, cream-colored, smelling of the lye that had scoured them and the creek water that had rinsed the lye away. The hooves came from the east, which was the direction of Cleveland, which was the direction of nothing in particular. A cart. She could tell by the rhythm: horse and wheel, horse and wheel, the uneven percussion of a loaded wagon on a rutted road.

She did not look. She pinned the sheet and her fingers found the next pin and she pinned the next sheet and the cart passed and the driver did not slow and the sound receded to the west and the sound was gone and her hands were shaking and she pressed them flat against the wet linen and felt the cold go through her palms into the bones of her fingers and she stood like that, hands pressed to a dead woman's sheets, until her pulse returned to its usual lie.

---

## Josiah

Josiah Ward had hands like a farmer's — broad, cracked at the knuckles, improbable on a man who spent his days with wire and battery acid. He was fifty-three when Elias met him, a Quaker from Ripley who had taught himself telegraphy from a manual and then taught three other men, two of them Black, because he believed, with the serene conviction of the deeply principled, that information was a river and everyone had a right to drink from it.

He taught Elias in the back room of his house on Sycamore Street. The equipment was secondhand — a salvaged register, a homemade key, batteries wired in series with stripped copper from a clock repair shop. The first lesson was not Morse code but acoustics. Josiah struck a tuning fork and held it near a second fork mounted on a wooden block, and the second fork began to hum.

"Not touching," Josiah said. "No wire. No mechanism. Just air."

Sympathetic resonance. One vibrating body setting another in motion at the same frequency, across a distance, through a medium neither of them could see. Josiah used it to explain the principle of the telegraph: a vibration in Cincinnati produces a vibration in Cleveland because the wire is the medium, the way air is the medium between the forks. The message is a frequency. The relay is a sympathetic body.

"You are the fork," Josiah told him. "The message passes through you. You must vibrate at its frequency or it dies in the wire."

Two years later, when the federal marshal came to Elias's boarding house and asked whether he knew that Josiah Ward had been using the telegraph network to send coded messages to Underground Railroad agents in Oberlin and Ashtabula, Elias said no. He said he did not know. He said he was only an operator. He said the wire carries everything and he carried nothing.

Josiah received six months in a federal penitentiary in Columbus. He had been released for eight months now and had not spoken to Elias and would not speak to Elias, and this was correct, and Elias accepted it, and his hands did not shake when he thought about it because he had trained his hands not to shake, which was different from not wanting to shake, which was different from not deserving to.

## Foxfire (1839)

She was twelve and her name was Prudence and the name did not fit, the way the shoes she was given each November did not fit — too large at first and too small by spring, the name an approximation of a person she had not yet become and would not become because she would choose a different name when she had the authority to choose, though she did not know that yet, standing at the edge of the woods behind the tobacco barn with an armload of kindling and the light failing and something glowing in the dark between the trees.

Blue-green. The color of nothing she had seen before. Not fire — fire was orange and yellow and white at its center and hot on the face even from a distance. This was cold. She could feel the coldness of it before she was close enough to see where it came from, a coldness that was also a color, the way a church bell is also a feeling in the chest.

A log. Fallen, half-sunk in the leaf mold, the bark peeling away in long curls and the exposed wood glowing. The glow was not steady. It pulsed, or seemed to pulse, though later she would learn that the pulsing was her own eyes adjusting, her pupils widening and narrowing as they tried to account for a light that had no source they recognized. The wood was rotting. She could smell it — the sweet, wet, collapsing smell of a thing returning to the ground it came from. And from this rot, from this decomposition, from this surrender of structure, the light.

She set down the kindling. She knelt. The forest floor was damp through the knees of her shift. She reached out and touched the glowing wood and it was cold and soft and her finger went into it slightly, the way a finger goes into bread dough, and the glow did not stop, and her finger glowed too for a moment, tipped with blue-green, as if the light were a liquid and she had dipped her hand in it.

She sat with the log until the dark was complete and the glow was the only light and her eyes had given up their preference for daylight and surrendered to this other spectrum, this cold fire, this illumination that asked nothing of her and gave nothing but itself. Somewhere behind her the tobacco barn held the cured leaves hanging in their rows, dark and dry and worth more per pound than she was worth per year, and the quarters beyond the barn held the people who had picked and hung those leaves, and beyond the quarters was the house where the man who owned the leaves and the people and the barn and the girl kneeling in the woods was eating his supper, and none of this was visible from where she knelt, and the log glowed, and she watched it.

Later, weeks later, she asked Old Abram about the light and he said foxfire. Said it came from the rotting — something in the wood that shone as the wood died. He said in Carolina, where he was born and from which he had been sold south and then sold west, they used to put pieces of the glowing wood along paths at night so you could find your way back. Markers. He said the light lasted days sometimes, weeks, depending on the wet and the cold.

She went back every evening until the glow faded. Nine days. On the tenth the log was dark and soft and shapeless, no longer a log but a suggestion of where a log had been, and the light was gone because the dying was done and there was nothing left to shine.

She kept the name Prudence for nine more years. She kept the memory of the foxfire for longer. It was the one beautiful thing that had not been provided by the man who owned her, that had not been rationed or permitted or revoked. The light came from decay and the decay was free and the light was free and she had knelt in it and no one had told her she could and no one had told her she could not and this was as close to ownership as she had come: a thing observed, in the dark, alone, that no one else's seeing could diminish.

## Three Walks

Wednesday evening. Elias left his boarding house on Elm Street at half past eight, walked south to the telegraph office on Third, stood across the street for four minutes, and walked home. He did this because he had decided to send the warning and then he had decided not to.

The warning was simple. Twelve words in the Quaker cipher that Josiah had taught him, which was not a sophisticated code but a pattern of substitutions — "shipment" for "person," "dry goods" for "fugitive," "expected arrival" for "warrant issued" — that would mean nothing to the Cleveland operator and everything to the contact in Oberlin, if the contact was still active, if the network had not collapsed when Josiah went to prison, if the woman on the receiving end of the twelve words was still alive and still willing.

He walked back to the office at nine-fifteen. The street was empty. The lamp in the office window was burning, which meant Ames, the night operator, was on duty. Elias could enter — he had a key, the office was his as much as Ames's — and sit at the relay desk and tap out twelve words on a line that carried everything. But Ames would see him. Ames would note the time and the fact that Elias had come in outside his shift. Ames was not a man of suspicion but he was a man of habit, and habit notes deviation.

Elias walked home.

At ten o'clock he walked back a third time. Ames's lamp was still burning. But the priority line was quiet — he could tell from the street by the silence of the sounder, which on busy nights was audible through the closed window, a faint insectile clicking. He went in.

"Forgot my gloves," he said.

Ames nodded without looking up from his newspaper.

Elias sat at the relay desk. His gloves were in his coat pocket where they had been all evening. He placed his fingers on the key. The brass was warm from the lamp heat. He thought about Josiah's hands on the same key. He thought about the tuning fork that vibrates without being touched. He thought: I am not a conduit.

---

## The Second Message

He sent it. Twelve words, Quaker cipher, routed to the Cleveland relay with a header that would direct it to the Oberlin sub-office, where it would be printed on a slip of paper and delivered by hand to a name he had memorized and never written down.

The transmission took eleven seconds. His hand was steady. When it was done he stood up and took his gloves from his pocket and put them on and nodded to Ames and left.

The night was cold and the stars were the ordinary stars and the wire above his head carried the twelve words north at one hundred and eighty-six thousand miles per second and Elias walked home at three miles per hour and the disparity between these two speeds was the distance between action and consequence, which is to say the distance within which a man can still pretend he has done nothing.

---

## Church

The AME church on South Professor Street held Wednesday prayer meeting at seven and Rue did not attend because she did not attend things. She washed the church's altar cloths and the minister's surplices and she delivered them folded and wrapped in muslin on Saturday mornings and she exchanged words with Mrs. Delphine Avery, the minister's wife, and these words were about linen and starch and never about the state of Rue's soul or the origins of her accent, which was not an Oberlin accent and not a Zanesville accent and which Mrs. Avery had the grace or the indifference not to question.

But on Thursday — the day after the Wednesday Rue had not attended — Mrs. Avery came to the house on East College Street and knocked on Rue's door and stood in the hallway with her coat still buttoned and said, "There is talk about marshals in Wellington."

Wellington was nine miles south. Marshals in Wellington could be there for any reason. A property dispute. A debtor.

"Federal marshals," Mrs. Avery said.

Rue said, "I see."

"Some of our people are making plans. There is a farm north of Pittsfield where—"

"I am from Zanesville," Rue said.

Mrs. Avery looked at her with an expression Rue could not classify — pity or impatience or the particular exhaustion of a woman who has heard the same lie from the same mouths in the same hallway too many times to count.

"Of course," Mrs. Avery said. "From Zanesville."

She left. Rue closed the door. The sound of Mrs. Avery's boots on the stairs descended and stopped and the front door opened and closed and the house was quiet and Rue stood in her room with her hands at her sides and the parallelogram of light was on the floor and her shoes were by the bed and nothing had changed and everything had changed and the difference between these two states was a woman in a hallway saying the word "federal."

## Shrinking

She did not pick up the Griffiths' laundry on Friday. She did not pick up the Widows' linens on Saturday. She stayed in her room. She counted the things she owned: the comb, the free paper, the twine, three dresses (one for work, one for church she did not attend, one folded in the bottom of the trunk in case she needed to become a different person quickly), two pairs of stockings, a shawl her neighbor had given her, a needle and thread, a tin cup, a plate, a fork, a knife. Thirteen things. She could carry all of them.

She had done this count before. Every Sunday evening for twenty-three months, the way other women counted their blessings. The number fluctuated: fourteen when she bought a new cake of soap, twelve when the stockings wore through, thirteen again when she darned them. The counting was not anxiety. It was inventory. The difference mattered to her even when it would not have mattered to anyone watching.

On Saturday night she heard horses on the road again and pressed her hands flat against the wall and felt the plaster cool against her palms and the vibration of the hooves traveled through the ground and through the foundation and through the wall and into her hands, or she imagined it did, and she held still until the sound passed and her hands remembered that they were hands and not instruments of detection and she lowered them and wiped them on her skirt as if they had touched something unclean.

## The Commissioner's Fee

A fugitive slave case paid ten dollars to the commissioner who ruled in favor of the claimant and five dollars to the commissioner who released the accused. This was in the law. The framers of the Act had not hidden it or even been embarrassed by it. The asymmetry was printed in the Federal Register the way cotton prices were printed in the commercial columns: a fact of the market, a number that described the relative value of outcomes, and anyone who looked at the numbers could see which outcome the system preferred, and the system did not care whether you looked.

Elias knew these numbers the way he knew the resistance coefficients for different gauges of copper wire — as technical specifications of a system he operated within. He had transmitted warrants that would result in ten-dollar rulings. He had transmitted weather reports that would result in nothing. The wire did not pay differently for different messages. His salary was the same whether the sounder clicked out a woman's height and scars or the closing price of iron ore in Pittsburgh. The system's preferences were not his preferences. He was inside the system the way the current was inside the wire: flowing through, not flowing from.

This was the logic. It was clean and it was correct and it was the logic of a man who had watched his mentor go to prison for refusing it.

---

## Cotton Prices

Monday. Elias sat at the relay desk and transcribed cotton prices from New Orleans. Eleven and five-eighths cents for middling uplands. Down an eighth from Friday. The market was soft. The numbers meant bales and the bales meant fields and the fields meant hands and the hands meant people and the people meant nothing in the grammar of the wire, which recognized only signal and silence, current and its absence, the dash and the dot and the space between.

He had sent the warning four days ago. He did not know whether it had arrived. He did not know whether the Oberlin contact was active. He did not know the name of the woman in the warrant — the warrant had given only the name of the man who claimed to own her, and Elias had not retained it, or had refused to retain it, which was different.

The sounder clicked and he transcribed. Wheat prices. A shipping manifest from Buffalo. A personal message from a woman in Columbus to her sister in Sandusky: MOTHER WORSE STOP COME IF YOU CAN STOP. He relayed each one. The wire carried grief and grain in the same current at the same speed, and his hands moved, and the messages passed through him the way light passes through glass, and he was transparent, and transparency was his profession, and he practiced it.

## The Visit

On Tuesday evening someone knocked on Rue's door and it was not Mrs. Avery. It was a woman Rue had seen at the church but did not know, a tall woman with a gap between her front teeth and a coat too thin for March, and the woman stood in the doorway and said, "You have to move tonight."

Rue said nothing.

"There is a wagon at the Platt farm. Midnight. It goes to Sandusky and from there by boat to—"

"Who sent you?"

The woman paused. "I don't know the chain. I know my part of it. My part is this door and these words and after that I go home and forget your face."

Rue looked at the woman's hands, which were rough and reddened and held nothing. No weapon. No document. Just the hands of a person who washed things or dug things or both, and who had walked through the cold to knock on a stranger's door and deliver twelve words' worth of instruction.

"Midnight," the woman said. "The Platt farm. Don't bring more than you can carry at a run."

She left. Rue stood in the doorway and listened to the woman's footsteps on the stairs and the front door and the silence that followed and she thought: the chain. A chain of people she had never met, extending from this door through the dark to some origin she would never know, each link knowing only the link before and the link after, the message degrading as it traveled the way sound degrades crossing water, arriving changed but recognizable. Someone, somewhere, had sent a signal. The signal had reached her. She did not know who or why or through what medium, and the not-knowing was the architecture of the thing — the safety was in the gaps, the freedom was in the ignorance, and she was alive because strangers had decided to vibrate at a frequency she could hear.

---

## North or South

She could go north. Sandusky, the boat, Canada. She had heard the names before — Chatham, Buxton, Dawn — settlements where Black Americans built schools and churches and argued about whether to call themselves exiles or emigrants. Safety. Another language of distance from the thing she had been.

Or south.

She sat on the edge of the bed and held her shoes in her lap. The laces hung loose. The leather was worn soft at the heels where her feet had broken them to her particular shape, and she thought about the shape of her feet, which was not the shape of anyone else's feet, which was the most private thing about her, more private than her name, because her name she had chosen and could change again but her feet were the feet she was born with, the same feet that had walked through the Kentucky river in December two years ago carrying nothing, leaving behind everything including the one thing she could not carry.

Bess. Three years old when Rue crossed the river. The child had been asleep. Rue had not woken her because a three-year-old cannot keep quiet in the cold and cannot walk fast enough and cannot swim if the ice breaks, and these were the facts, and the facts were correct, and Rue had left her daughter asleep in the quarter and walked into the river and the water was so cold it stopped her breathing and she kept walking.

She had told herself: I will come back. When I am settled. When I have money. When the route is safer. She had told herself this for twenty-three months. She had not gone back. She would not have gone back. The route was not safer. She did not have money. And Bess was five now, or would be in April, and five is old enough to remember a mother's face and old enough to stop expecting it.

North was logical. North was survival. North was the direction every piece of advice she had ever received pointed, the direction the stars were arranged to indicate, the direction of freedom in the grammar of every runaway she had known.

She put on her shoes.

South was her daughter.

## Frequency

Elias did not know whether the warning had reached anyone. This was by design — the system worked because no single node possessed enough information to betray the whole. He knew he had sent twelve words. He knew the words had traveled the wire to Cleveland. After that, the signal entered a human network he could not map, could not monitor, could not verify, and this was correct, and this was maddening, and this was the difference between the telegraph and the underground: the telegraph confirmed delivery, the underground confirmed nothing.

He sat at his desk and held the galena. The crystal's faces reflected the lamp in miniature, six small fires in a gray stone. He thought about Josiah's tuning forks. One vibrating body setting another in motion across a room, through air, through nothing visible. He had sent a vibration into the wire. Somewhere, possibly, a sympathetic body had received it. Or possibly the vibration had met resistance and died in the copper, the way most signals die, attenuated by distance, degraded by the medium, arriving as noise or arriving not at all.

He set the galena down. He picked up his pencil. A message was coming in from Columbus — a state legislative report, routine, filling the wire with the ordinary business of governance, which included, among its line items, the governance of human property, which included, among its instruments, the wire on which Elias now transcribed the news that the Ohio General Assembly had tabled a motion to amend the personal liberty law, which meant the Fugitive Slave Act stood unreformed, which meant the warrant he had transmitted five days ago was still law, which meant his twelve words were either sufficient or they were not, and the wire would not tell him which.

## Bess

The last time she saw her daughter, Bess was sleeping on a pallet in the quarter with her thumb in her mouth and her knees drawn up and the blanket kicked to her waist. Rue had watched her breathe for ten minutes. She counted the breaths. She told herself she was memorizing the child's face but what she was memorizing was the rhythm of the breathing, the small catches and releases, the particular sigh Bess made when she shifted, and later, in the weeks of walking north, it was not Bess's face she remembered but the sound of her sleeping, which she heard in wind and in creek water and in the rhythm of her own footsteps, the way a melody, once heard, inserts itself into every subsequent silence.

She had not named the child. The owner named children. He named them from a list he kept in a ledger in his office — names recycled from the dead, the sold, the run. The child's name in the ledger was Bessie, which was the name of a woman who had been sold south in 1848, and Rue had shortened it to Bess in her own mouth, this small alteration the only authorship permitted her, and even this was precarious, because the owner's wife also called the child Bess, and which of them had shortened it first was a question Rue could not answer and did not ask.

She was walking south now. She had left the Platt farm road three miles back and cut through a maple wood where the trees were old enough that their roots broke the ground in ridges she had to step over in the dark. She walked by feel. The stars were visible through the canopy gaps but she was not navigating by stars — she was navigating by slope, by the downhill tendency that meant water, that meant a creek or a river, that meant south, because in Ohio the water flows south to the river and the river flows west to the Mississippi and the Mississippi flows south to the gulf and everything, if you follow the water, leads back to the country from which she had escaped.

The night smelled of thaw. The ground was soft under last year's leaves, the frost loosening its grip on the topsoil, releasing the trapped scent of earth and mold and the faint sweetness of something beginning to rot beneath the leaf litter — mushrooms, maybe, or a fallen branch breaking down into the dark chemistry that produced, in certain conditions, in certain woods, in certain temperatures, the glow she had once watched for nine nights as a child. She did not expect to see it tonight. She did not expect anything tonight except the next step, and the step after that, and the continuation of a movement that had no endpoint she could name, only a direction and a face she was walking toward that she could no longer picture clearly, because twenty-three months is enough time for a child's face to change beyond a mother's memory, and the face she carried was a three-year-old's face on a body that was now five, and the mismatch between image and fact was one more thing she would have to reconcile if she arrived, and if she did not arrive the mismatch would not matter, and this was the kind of arithmetic that sustained her: the subtraction of worry by the possibility of failure.

## The Road South

Her feet knew the terrain before her eyes did. Root, stone, leaf-mat, mud. She catalogued each surface by the sound it made under her weight: the dry crackle of last year's oak leaves, the silence of bare packed earth, the small sucking sound of clay after rain. She walked with her hands in front of her when the canopy closed overhead and the dark was total, and her fingers found branches and spiderwebs and once the wet nose of a deer that startled and crashed away through the underbrush, and her heart hammered and she stopped and listened and heard nothing but the deer's retreat diminishing into the ordinary sounds of a forest at night — the creek somewhere ahead, an owl, the wind in the bare upper branches making a sound like a woman shushing a child.

She did not know the route. She knew the direction. South to the river, the river that she had crossed going north in December 1851 with ice on the banks and the current so fast the ferryman had refused and she had walked in at the narrowest point and the water had taken her breath and she had kept walking. She would have to cross it again. She did not think about this. She thought about the next step, which was a root, and the step after that, which was mud, and the step after that.

Twelve miles to the river, if she was where she thought she was. Five hours of walking in the dark over rough ground. She would reach the bank before dawn if she did not stop and she would not stop because stopping was a decision and she had already made the only decision that mattered, which was south, and everything after south was just walking.

Her calves burned. Her left shoe had rubbed a blister on her heel in the first mile and now the blister had opened and the sock was wet with something that was probably blood and the pain was a metronome, steady, one pulse per step, and she let it count for her so she did not have to count herself.

She thought about the woman who had come to her door. The gap between her teeth. The coat too thin for March. That woman had walked through the cold to deliver twelve words to a stranger and then walked home and would forget Rue's face, as she had promised, and Rue would forget hers, and the forgetting was the mechanism, the safety protocol, the way the system erased its own trail the way water erases footprints in sand. Every link in the chain forgot the link before it. The message survived; the messenger dissolved. It was the opposite of how Rue had lived in Oberlin — holding still, becoming permanent, building a life from the accumulation of small fixed things: the room, the parallelogram, the creek, the Griffiths' shirts. The chain was motion. The chain was impermanence. The chain was what she had tried to stop being, and here she was, in the dark, in the woods, a link again, moving.

## Ames

On Saturday evening Ames had asked Elias about the gloves. Not suspiciously — Ames did not have the architecture for suspicion — but conversationally, the way a man who sits alone in a room for eight hours will latch onto any anomaly as a subject for speech.

"Found them all right?"

"In my desk drawer," Elias said. "I thought I'd left them."

"I do that with my pipe. Leave it, come back for it, find it in my pocket the whole time." Ames shook his head. "The mind plays its tricks."

Elias agreed that the mind played its tricks and left and walked home and lay in his bed at the boarding house on Elm Street and stared at the ceiling and thought about tricks. The mind's trick was to create a story around the act — a reason, a justification, a narrative frame that made the act seem inevitable rather than chosen. He had chosen. In the eleven seconds between the first keystroke and the last, he had been a person making a choice, and now the choice was made and the person remained and the story was already forming around the choice like scar tissue around a wound, covering it, protecting it, making it disappear into the ordinary surface of his life.

He turned on his side. Through the wall he could hear his neighbor coughing — a persistent, wet cough that had been worsening for weeks. The cough was a sound without intention. It did not mean to keep Elias awake. It did not mean anything. It was a body doing what a body does, and the wall between them carried the vibration from one room to the next, and Elias lay in the dark and listened to a stranger's lungs through plaster and lath, and the listening was involuntary, and the listening was all there was.

## Tuesday

On Tuesday morning Elias arrived at the relay desk at 5:30 and the first message was a property dispute from Cleveland. A man named Hiram Shedd claimed title to a lot on Superior Street that a man named Thomas Fogg had fenced without permission. Elias transcribed the details with the same care he gave every message — the lot dimensions, the date of the original deed, the name of the surveyor — and his hands were steady, and the message passed through him, and the galena sat on his desk reflecting nothing.

He did not know whether the woman in the warrant was alive. He did not know whether the woman in the warrant had received a warning. He did not know whether the warning had traveled the chain from Cleveland to Oberlin to a door he had never seen, to a woman whose name he had never learned, whose scar he had transcribed as part of a description that was also an instrument of capture, whose body existed in his professional memory as a series of Morse characters: five feet four, scar left forearm, dark complexion.

The sounder clicked. He transcribed. A weather report from Erie: clear skies, northwest wind, the lake calm. A commercial circular from Pittsburgh: iron prices holding steady at twenty-six dollars per ton. The wire carried its ordinary freight and Elias carried the wire's cargo to paper and the paper accumulated on the desk in a small pile of messages that meant nothing to him and everything to someone and he was the instrument through which the meaning passed, untouched by the passing, unaltered, the galena that converts the invisible to the audible without itself making a sound.

His hands did not shake. He noticed this. He could not tell whether the stillness meant he had done the right thing or whether it meant he had simply done a thing, and the body, relieved of indecision, does not distinguish between right and done. The stillness might be peace. The stillness might be the beginning of the particular numbness that allows a man to transmit a warrant and a warning on the same instrument without feeling the contradiction, because the instrument does not feel, and he was becoming the instrument, and this was either his salvation or his damnation, and the wire would not tell him which, and the morning was ordinary, and he worked.

## Walking South

The woods thickened south of Pittsfield and the ground dropped and the air grew damp in the way that meant water close. Rue walked with one hand on the trunks of trees, feeling the bark under her fingers — the shaggy strips of hickory, the shallow grooves of ash, the smooth gray plates of beech that felt, in the dark, like the skin of something alive and cold-blooded. She was listening for water. She was listening for horses. She was listening for dogs, though she had not heard dogs and the absence of dogs was either luck or a fact about the marshals' methods that she did not have enough information to interpret.

Her breathing had steadied into the rhythm of distance. In and step and out and step. The air was sharp in her nostrils and carried the mineral smell of creek water and the animal smell of wet fur — a fox or a raccoon somewhere in the undergrowth, invisible, aware of her passing the way she was aware of the telegraph wires strung above the roads she had crossed earlier that night, humming with messages she could not hear, carrying information about her body from one city to another at a speed her body could never match. She had seen the wires and felt nothing about them. They were part of the landscape the way fences were part of the landscape: structures built by people who believed in the permanence of their claims. The wires would outlast her. The wires were already outlasting her, carrying the description of her arm and her height and her darkness to men who would read the description and convert it from language into pursuit. She did not think about the wires. She thought about the next step. She did not think about what was ahead. She did not think about the river. She did not think about what lay on the other side of the river, which was Kentucky, which was the state that had made her property and from which she had escaped, into which she was now returning of her own will for the first time in her life, and the phrase "of her own will" was so unfamiliar in her mouth that she almost said it aloud, just to hear whether the words sounded like a language she spoke.

She came over a low ridge and down through a stand of birch, white trunks catching what little light the sky offered, and at the bottom of the ridge, beside a creek she could hear but not yet see, a stump.

The stump was glowing.

Blue-green. The color of the memory she carried from the woods behind the tobacco barn when she was twelve and her name was Prudence and the world was a place where rotting wood could produce its own cold light. Foxfire. The fungi in the dead wood feeding on the decay and producing, as a byproduct of their feeding, this glow — not warm, not a fire at all, but a luminescence, a light made by consumption, by the slow dissolution of what had once been solid and vertical and alive.

She stopped. She had been walking for four hours without stopping and she stopped. The glow was steady and faint, barely enough to see by, but enough to see — the texture of the bark peeling away from the stump, the shelf mushrooms growing in tiers along the cut face, the moss at the base dark and wet and glittering in the foxfire's light as if strewn with small cold gems. The creek beyond it caught the glow and carried it, a blue-green thread in the black water, moving south.

She did not kneel. She did not touch it. She was not twelve, and the beauty did not belong to her in the way it had belonged to the girl who knelt in the woods and felt the cold light on her fingertip and sat for an hour in wonder. That girl had nowhere to go. Rue had somewhere to go. The beauty was real and the urgency was real and they occupied the same moment the way the glow occupied the rot — inseparable, the one feeding on the other, the light impossible without the death of the wood.

She looked at it for the length of one breath. The blue-green on the stump and the shelf mushrooms and the water. The cold of it. The silence of a light that makes no sound.

Then she walked. South. The creek beside her, the water finding its way down to the river she would have to cross, the stump behind her still glowing for no one, the woods dark ahead and dark behind and dark on all sides, and her feet on the ground making the sound feet make on wet earth, which is barely a sound, which is almost silence, which is the frequency below—
