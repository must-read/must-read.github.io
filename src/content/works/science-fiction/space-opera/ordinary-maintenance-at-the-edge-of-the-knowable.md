formulaSummary: "Chambers' empathetic found-family warmth aboard a battered supply ship meets Clarke's precise rendering of the truly alien, as a maintenance technician who has spent nine years avoiding grief enters an artifact that defies every system she knows."
synopsis: "When a second alien object appears and opens for a supply vessel's crew, chief technician Naveli Kaur enters — not as an explorer, but as a woman who has spent nine years fixing everything except what matters."
combination:
  fromAuthorA:
    - "Found-family warmth aboard the Meridian — the cook-scientist, the bickering galley debates, the crew as domestic unit where competence and care are indistinguishable"
    - "Diversity treated as unremarkable — multi-ethnic crew, varied ages and experience levels, cultural differences as texture rather than conflict"
    - "The small personal moment inside the vast cosmic setting — Naveli's confession about her mother's garden carrying the same weight as the alien encounter"
  fromAuthorB:
    - "Hard-science rendering of the alien — instruments giving contradictory readings, geometries that defy external dimensions, technical language that ultimately fails before the truly incomprehensible"
    - "Clean precise prose — declarative sentences, specific numbers, wonder earned through clarity rather than purple prose"
    - "The final-paragraph revelation — the incomplete energy curve suggesting a larger pattern, the mystery that deepens rather than resolves"

The mineral content in the *Meridian*'s number-three water recycler has been climbing for six days, and Naveli is fairly certain she knows why, but Poul will not stop talking long enough for her to explain.

"It's the basil," he says, leaning into the access panel beside her with his arms folded across his chest, as if he is supervising rather than obstructing. "The roots are reaching the filtration membrane. I've seen it before."

"You've never seen it before." Naveli twists the hex coupling another quarter-turn, feels the seal catch. Her hands are steady the way they always are inside machines — sure of their purchase, certain of what comes next. "You've been growing that basil for eight weeks and the roots are eleven centimeters long. The membrane is behind forty centimeters of composite housing. Your basil is not the problem."

"You don't know how determined basil can be."

"I know exactly how determined basil can be. It's not determined enough." She withdraws her arm from the panel and wipes the coupling grease on her coveralls — the left thigh, where a permanent dark smear has taken on the approximate shape of Lake Baikal, which Dae pointed out two months ago and which Naveli has never been able to unsee. "The calcium exchanger is scaling. I need to flush it with citric acid, which I would have done yesterday if someone hadn't used my entire supply to descale the coffee machine."

Poul has the grace to look briefly ashamed. He is forty-six, broad-shouldered, with a salt-and-pepper beard he trims with the same meticulous care he brings to his exobiology samples and his cooking. The crew manifest lists him as Senior Exobiologist. In practice he runs the galley, tends the hydroponics bay, and occasionally remembers to publish a paper. The *Meridian* is that kind of ship — small enough that everyone does three jobs and complains about two of them.

"I can synthesize more citric acid," he offers.

"From what?"

"I have lemons."

"You have a lemon. Singular. And it's for the fish tonight."

"Naveli. It's engineered tilapia. It doesn't care about the lemon."

She is about to tell him that she cares about the lemon — that the lemon, in fact, represents the only fresh citrus within four astronomical units and deserves considerably more respect than it is getting — when the proximity alert chimes.

It is a soft sound, three ascending tones, the kind of alert designed for events that require attention but not alarm. Naveli has heard it perhaps two hundred times in her career: an asteroid within monitoring distance, a course adjustment from traffic control, a solar weather advisory. She does not move. Neither does Poul. They have been in space long enough to know the difference between alerts that require your hands and alerts that require your eyes. The alert chimes again, and the ship's general channel opens with a click.

"All hands, this is Osen." The captain's voice carries its usual quality of measured calm, as if every sentence has been reviewed and edited before delivery. "We're within sensor range of the Alcyone Object. I'd like everyone on the observation deck in twenty, but there's no rush. Finish what you're doing."

Naveli finishes what she is doing. She seals the access panel, logs the calcium exchanger for citric flush — noting in the maintenance record that she will need to source the citric acid from somewhere other than Poul's lemon — and cleans her tools. She hangs the hex driver on its peg, coils the diagnostic cable, wipes the access panel surround with a cloth. None of this is strictly necessary. She does it anyway.

Poul waits, because Poul always waits for her. He has the patient attention of a man who studies organisms that evolve over geological timescales; a few extra minutes in a mechanical bay does not trouble him. When she is ready, they walk together through the *Meridian*'s central corridor, which smells the way it always smells: recycled air and cumin and the faintly astringent cleaning solution Dae uses on the engine components, which she insists is industrial-grade but which Naveli suspects is mostly vinegar.

The observation deck is a generous term for a reinforced viewport bay roughly the size of a large closet. Captain Osen is already there, hands clasped behind his back. He is sixty-one and has commanded supply vessels for longer than Naveli has been fixing them. Dae stands beside him with her arms wrapped around herself, her small frame tense in the way it gets before she has decided how worried to be. Liat, at twenty-three the youngest aboard by nearly a decade, presses her forehead against the viewport glass. Remi, the navigator, sits cross-legged on the floor with a thermos of tea.

The Alcyone Object fills the lower quarter of the viewport.

It is two point three kilometers along its longest axis. Its surface is the color of old iron, though spectrographic analysis has never matched it to any known alloy or composite. It orbits the gas giant Kepler-442c at a distance of 1.6 million kilometers — close enough to catch the planet's pale blue light along one flank, far enough to appear autonomous. It is not rotating. Forty years ago, the first Alcyone Object passed through the outer system in nine months, was tracked by a long-haul relay station, catalogued, studied at insufficient resolution, and never seen again. This one arrived fourteen months ago, decelerated from interstellar velocity over a period of six weeks — a feat that implied an energy budget larger than Earth's annual output — and has been motionless since. It is, by any reasonable measure, the most significant discovery in human history.

The *Meridian* has come to service the sensor array that monitors it.

"Well," Poul says quietly. "There it is."

Nobody answers. There is nothing useful to say. The Object is there, as it has been there for over a year, and looking at it does not make it more comprehensible. Naveli studies its surface — the faint geometric patterning visible at this range, hexagonal tessellations that repeat at decreasing scales, like frost on a window or the compound eye of something immense. She has read every published paper on both Objects. She has seen the spectrographic data, the mass estimates, the fruitless attempts at radio contact. None of it prepared her for the simple fact of the thing hanging in space, silent and entire and not for her.

"Remi," Osen says. "What's the array status?"

"Forty-seven of sixty-two nodes operational. Fifteen offline — mostly thermal failures in the solar panels. Standard degradation for equipment this age." Remi takes a sip of tea. "Also, there's a hole in it."

The silence that follows is the particular kind that happens when six people simultaneously decide not to be the first to ask.

"In the array?" Osen says.

"In the Object."

---

They gather around the galley table because that is where the *Meridian*'s crew has always made its decisions — over Poul's cooking, surrounded by the residual warmth of whatever he has most recently burned. The galley is small and cluttered and smells permanently of garlic and machine oil, the two scents having achieved some kind of détente in the ship's ventilation system years before any of them came aboard. The table has a persistent wobble in its third leg that no one has fixed because Dae wedges her boot under it during meals and considers this a solved problem.

Remi projects the sensor data above the table's surface. The aperture is a circle, 9.4 meters in diameter, located on the Object's sunward face. It is geometrically perfect — not smooth in the way of natural erosion or impact damage, but perfect in the way of a compass and straightedge, its edge a line of zero thickness separating exterior surface from interior darkness. It was not present in the last survey drone's pass eleven months ago. It is present now.

"The shuttle bay doors are eight point two meters across," Dae says immediately. She has already done the math. This is what Dae does when she is frightened: she converts fear into numbers and checks them twice.

"That's not an invitation," Osen says.

"It's not not an invitation," Liat says.

"Liat."

"Captain, I'm just pointing out that a circular opening exactly large enough for our shuttle, appearing for the first time in forty years of observation, on the same month a crewed vessel arrives within range — that is a great deal of coincidence to attribute to geology."

"It's not geology," Poul says quietly. "It's not anything we have a word for."

"We have a word for trap," Dae says.

"We also have a word for door," Liat fires back.

Remi, who has said nothing, refills her tea from the pot at the center of the table.

Osen looks at Naveli. He does this when the conversation fractures — not because she outranks anyone, but because she has been doing this longer than anyone except him, and she does not say things she has not thought through.

"Naveli?"

She is thinking about response lag. Eleven hours to mission control at Callisto. Eleven hours back. Twenty-two hours during which the aperture might close, might change, might never appear again. She is thinking about the fact that no military vessel, no science flagship, no diplomatic envoy will reach this orbit for three months minimum — the nearest research fleet is at Tau Ceti, five weeks out even under maximum burn. She is thinking about the first Alcyone Object, how it passed through the entire solar system and humanity did nothing but watch it go, and how that watching was described in every textbook she ever read as a failure of nerve and infrastructure.

She is also thinking — and this thought she does not examine too closely — about the nine years she has spent moving from one repair job to the next without stopping.

"I can pilot the approach," she says.

Dae's face goes white. "That's not what he asked."

"I know what he asked."

"You don't know what's in there. None of us do. The structural analysis alone — the interior temperature, the atmosphere, the radiation profiles —"

"All readable from the shuttle's instruments before we cross the threshold."

"If the threshold lets you stop. If it doesn't seal behind you. If the interior dimensions are stable, which, given that this thing is two point three kilometers across and the radar cross-section of the internal structures reads as six kilometers —" Dae catches herself, takes a breath. Her engineering mind is a wonderful thing, but it tends to run ahead of her ability to stay calm. "Naveli, the interior is bigger than the exterior. You understand that? The geometry doesn't work. The geometry is wrong."

"Dae." Osen's voice, calm and final. "Let her finish."

But Naveli is finished. She has said what she means. Across the table, Liat is watching her with an expression Naveli recognizes from two decades ago, from her own face in her first posting on a cargo hauler out of Europa: the desperate hope that someone older and steadier will make the decision that justifies the risk.

"I want Poul for bio-assessment," Naveli says. "And Liat for sensors."

"I haven't said yes," Osen says.

"I know." She waits. Around the table, the crew watches them — Osen with his hands flat on the wobbling surface, Naveli with hers in her lap, and between them the projected image of a perfect circle in the skin of something that should not exist.

He says yes.

---

The shuttle is called the *Gosling*, a name Liat chose during her first week aboard because she thought it was funny for a small craft deployed from a larger bird. Nobody laughed at the time. Everyone uses the name now.

Naveli runs the pre-flight checks methodically, without rushing, giving each system the attention it deserves. Atmosphere containment. Hull integrity. Thruster alignment. Sensor calibration. Emergency beacon — which will be useless inside the Object, since the walls attenuate all known transmission frequencies, but she checks it anyway, because that is what you do. You check the systems. You trust the procedure. You go.

Poul settles into the second seat with his sample kit on his lap like a child holding a lunchbox on the first day of school. He has packed for every contingency his training covers and several it does not, and the kit bulges accordingly. Liat takes the sensor station behind them and begins a continuous data stream back to the *Meridian*, her fingers quick and certain on the console. Whatever anxiety she felt at the galley table has been absorbed into procedure.

"Gosling, you are cleared for departure." Osen's voice in the headset, steady as a metronome. "Maintain open comms as long as signal holds. Return protocol is your discretion, Naveli. If anything reads outside human-safe parameters, you come back."

"Understood."

"And bring Poul home. He's the only one who knows the seasoning ratios."

"Understood, Captain."

The *Gosling* detaches from the *Meridian*'s underbelly with a gentle shudder. Naveli guides it forward across the seventeen-kilometer gap between their orbit and the Object's surface, the thrusters firing in small controlled bursts that she times by instinct. Behind them, the *Meridian* grows smaller in the rear cameras — a battered, reliable shape, its running lights blinking in the patient rhythm of a vessel that has never been anywhere dramatic and has never expected to be. Ahead, the Object grows larger in a way that is not just visual but conceptual, a slow expansion of the idea of it in Naveli's mind. At five kilometers, it is an object. At two, it is a place. At five hundred meters, the hexagonal patterning on the hull becomes a landscape — each cell roughly two hundred meters across, their edges raised like the walls of an ancient city seen from altitude. Some cells are darker than others. Some appear to contain finer structures within them, though the resolution of the shuttle's cameras cannot resolve the detail. The aperture waits ahead: a dark circle against dark iron, distinguishable only by the absolute absence of reflected light within its boundary. No reflected starlight. No scatter. A hole in the electromagnetic spectrum, 9.4 meters across.

"Radiation nominal," Liat reports. Her voice has settled into the flat cadence of a technician reading instruments, which is exactly what she is. "Magnetic field stable. No particulate emissions. Temperature differential at the threshold is..." A pause. The sound of fingers recalibrating sensors. "That can't be right. Hold on." Another pause, longer. "The interior reads as nineteen degrees Celsius. Atmospheric nitrogen-oxygen mix at close to standard pressure. Trace water vapor, trace carbon dioxide, no toxins detected. Naveli, that's a breathable atmosphere in there."

"Noted." She does not say what she is thinking, which is that a breathable atmosphere inside an alien artifact of unknown origin is more troubling than a vacuum would have been. A vacuum is indifferent. An atmosphere is prepared.

They cross the threshold at four meters per second. There is no barrier, no field, no sensation of transition. One moment they are in open space with stars behind them and the blue curve of the gas giant below; the next, they are inside.

The interior of the Alcyone Object does not match its exterior dimensions.

This is the first thing Naveli's instruments confirm and the first thing her mind refuses to accept. The shuttle's lidar returns a distance of 4.7 kilometers to the nearest vertical surface. The Object's external long axis is 2.3 kilometers. She checks the reading, recalibrates the lidar, checks it again. The numbers do not change.

They are inside a space roughly twice the size of the thing that contains it.

The *Gosling*'s floodlights illuminate perhaps two hundred meters ahead. Beyond that, the interior is lit by its own sources — pale luminescence from structures that rise from the curved floor like ribs, ridged and branching, their surfaces textured with the same hexagonal patterning as the exterior hull but smaller here, centimeters across, pulsing in sequences too regular to be random and too complex to be mechanical. The colors shift through ranges Naveli's eye parses as blue-green and amber. The spectrometer identifies frequencies that correspond to no known chemistry.

"Convergent evolution," Poul whispers. Then he stops. He closes his mouth, opens it, closes it again. "No. That's not what this is. Convergent evolution requires a shared selective pressure. This isn't..." He gestures at the ribbed structures rising around them, their branches interweaving overhead in patterns that suggest growth but not biology, design but not engineering. "I don't have a framework for this."

"What is it?" Liat asks.

"I don't know." He says this simply, and Naveli respects him for it. There are people who would have kept talking, kept forcing the unfamiliar into familiar shapes. Poul lets it be unfamiliar.

The shuttle drifts forward. Naveli keeps the speed low — eight meters per second, the pace of a brisk walk. On either side, the ribbed structures rise and curve overhead, their branches interweaving at heights the lidar places at 1.2 kilometers above them. The atmosphere outside the shuttle hull is breathable, nineteen degrees, one standard atmosphere of pressure. Every instrument says the same thing: this environment is survivable. None of them say why. None of them say for whom.

They pass through corridors — the word is wrong, but human language is all they have — where the structures narrow and the bioluminescent patterning brightens, casting geometric shadows across the shuttle's hull. In one stretch, the hexagonal cells pulse in unison, a single slow wave of light that travels from behind them and vanishes into the distance ahead. In another, the floor drops away. The lidar reports nine hundred meters of depth, the walls spiraling down in tightening patterns.

Poul records everything. His sample kit remains closed. At one point he says, very softly, "The branching ratios — close to 1.618. But not exactly. The deviation is consistent." He does not say what this means.

Liat's sensor station begins to change.

It starts small — a secondary display cycling through datasets Liat did not request. Atmospheric composition readings tagged to biomes that do not exist in any database. Spectral analyses of light sources that do not match the shuttle's floodlights or the Object's bioluminescence or anything else. Then the primary display flickers, goes dark for half a second, and resolves into a pattern Naveli has never seen: concentric rings of data points, rotating slowly around a central axis, annotated in a notation system that is not any human language and is not, as far as she can tell, random. The symbols repeat, but not cyclically. They build on each other, each ring adding complexity to the one inside it.

"I'm not doing this," Liat says. Her voice is very flat. She is checking the same sensor calibration she checked thirty seconds ago. She will check it again in thirty seconds. "The system is receiving input from an external source. I don't know what the source is. I don't know what the data means. I've tried to isolate it — it's coming through the hull sensors. It's not a signal in any conventional sense. It's more like the shuttle's instruments are reading the Object's environment and translating it into our display format, but the translation doesn't correspond to anything in our reference libraries. I'm getting physical constants that don't match any known values."

Naveli watches the concentric rings turn on Liat's screen. She does not understand them. Twenty-two years of reading systems, finding their faults, correcting their drifts — and this system is opaque to her.

She sets the shuttle to hold position and unbuckles her restraints.

"Naveli?" Poul looks at her with the careful attention he gives to organisms he cannot classify.

"I'm going to sit with Liat for a minute."

She moves aft to the sensor station and lowers herself into the jump seat beside the younger woman. Liat's hands are moving over the console in the same repetitive pattern — calibrate, check, reset, calibrate — and her jaw is set in a way that Naveli recognizes because she has worn that same expression herself, for years, in empty corridors and maintenance bays and the long watches between stars. The retreat into procedure when the world becomes too large to hold.

"My mother grew frangipani on Titan," Naveli says.

Liat's hands pause. "What?"

"In the generation station. Deck fourteen, section nine. She had a terraced plot — maybe four meters by six — with artificial soil she spent sixteen years getting the pH right on. Frangipani and jasmine. Tropical flowers in a dome on a moon of Saturn, where the surface temperature is minus one hundred and seventy-nine degrees and the sunlight is a hundredth of what those plants evolved to expect." Naveli watches the rings turn on the display. "Everyone told her it was absurd. The light was wrong, the gravity was wrong, the soil chemistry was a guess built on other guesses. She did it anyway. She rigged UV supplements from grow-light components she bartered from the agricultural deck. She composted her own kitchen waste for sixteen years to build that soil. She used to say that the flowers didn't know they were in the wrong place, so they just grew."

"That sounds like her," Liat says, and then blinks, because she has never met the woman. "I mean — that sounds like a good thing."

"She died nine years ago. Complications from a respiratory condition she'd had for years — the station air on Titan was never quite right, too dry, not enough particulate filtration in the older decks. I was three weeks out on a cargo run to the Kuiper depot. The message came through on a forty-minute delay. By the time I heard her voice — my sister's voice, I mean, telling me — my mother had been dead for almost an hour." Naveli keeps her voice level. "The *Meridian* was between rotations. I could have rerouted to Titan. Taken leave. Gone to the memorial, seen the garden. My sister Preet was there. My cousins. Everyone." She pauses. The rings turn. The Object breathes around them in its slow bioluminescent pulse. "I logged in to the next deployment instead. There was a water recycler on a relay station near Neptune that needed servicing. I told myself it couldn't wait."

Liat has stopped checking the calibration. Her hands rest on the console, motionless. "Could it?"

"It was a water recycler. They're always important. There's always one that needs servicing." She looks at Liat. "I couldn't tell you what kind of frangipani my mother grew. I think it was the yellow kind. I'm not sure. I can tell you the maintenance history of every recycler I've touched since she died. Hundreds of them. I know their model numbers."

The display between them continues its slow rotation. The bioluminescent cells pulse around them in their slow overlapping rhythms.

"I don't know what any of this means," Liat says quietly.

"Neither do I." Naveli puts her hand on the console beside Liat's, not quite touching. "I don't know if this is important or if I'm just tired of always having somewhere else to be."

Liat says nothing. After a moment, she stops reaching for the calibration controls. She folds her hands in her lap and watches the rings turn, and Naveli watches them with her.

---

The central chamber is seven kilometers ahead. They know this because the shuttle's lidar reports a vast open space at the heart of the Object — a spherical void approximately three kilometers in diameter, the largest single volume inside the already-impossible interior. Every instrument aboard the *Gosling* agrees that something is present in that void. None of them can describe what.

Naveli returns to the pilot's seat and guides them forward. The ribbed structures thin and fall away as they travel deeper, opening into broader passages where the pale light intensifies and the hexagonal patterning on the walls grows finer, almost fractal, each cell containing smaller cells containing smaller cells until the resolution of the human eye fails and the surface appears to shimmer like heat over pavement. Poul has given up on his sample kit. He sits with his hands in his lap, watching the walls flow past with an expression that is not wonder and not fear but something between — the face of a man who has spent his career preparing for a moment that, now that it has arrived, bears no resemblance to the preparation.

They enter the central chamber.

It is a sphere, three point one kilometers in diameter. The inner surface carries the same luminescent patterning as the corridors but brighter here, shifting through frequencies from deep infrared to near ultraviolet. Most of it invisible to the eye. Naveli feels it as warmth on her skin, a faint pressure behind the temples.

At the center of the sphere, there is a presence.

It is not a shape. The lidar finds no surface to reflect from. The thermal sensors read a temperature gradient — warmer toward the center by 2.3 degrees, cooling toward the sphere's inner walls — that suggests mass without substance, density without matter. The electromagnetic sensors report a field fluctuating in patterns that match the concentric rings still turning on Liat's display, faster now, the unknown notation systems building toward something that might be a statement or a question or neither. The visual spectrum shows nothing. The eye sees empty air where every instrument insists something exists.

It is aware of them the way an ocean is aware of a wave.

Naveli knows this without knowing how. There is no communication, no signal, no message. But there is something attentive in the space — not directed at them, not interested in them, but aware like a room where someone is singing alone.

She shuts down the shuttle's engines. The *Gosling* drifts, frictionless, in the center of the sphere.

"Naveli," Poul says softly. "What do we do?"

She thinks about all the things she knows how to do — recalibrate, repair, flush, seal, replace. She thinks about the deployment schedule she logged into instead of a shuttle home to Titan. She thinks about the number-three water recycler on the *Meridian*, its calcium exchanger still waiting for citric acid.

"Nothing," she says. "We do nothing."

They sit in the shuttle, in the center of the sphere, in the presence of something that does not need them to understand it. Liat's displays cycle through their unknown patterns. Poul holds his sample kit against his chest and does not open it. Naveli breathes. The bioluminescent walls pulse in slow overlapping rhythms, and the warmth from the invisible center radiates through the hull in waves so gentle they might be imagined, and the shuttle's clock counts seconds with the same mechanical patience it brings to all intervals, extraordinary and otherwise.

They stay for forty-one minutes.

Naveli does not know why they stay for exactly that long. There is no signal to leave, as there was no signal to stay. At some point the stillness completes itself — not a revelation, not an understanding, but the way a held breath releases because the body decides before the mind does.

"Okay," Naveli says. She starts the engines.

---

The aperture is still open when they return. The *Gosling* passes through it into ordinary space — stars, the blue glow of Kepler-442c, the battered familiar hull of the *Meridian* seventeen kilometers distant — and Naveli feels the transition this time, not as a physical sensation but as a loss she carries in her hands without knowing what to do with them.

Behind them, the aperture closes. It does not shrink or contract. One moment it is there; the next, the Object's surface is continuous and unmarked, as if the circle had never existed. Liat confirms on sensors. No trace. No seam. No scar.

They dock with the *Meridian*. The clamps engage with a familiar clunk that reverberates through the shuttle's frame, and Naveli sits for a moment with her hands on the controls, feeling the ship take the *Gosling*'s weight, feeling the vibration of the *Meridian*'s systems conducting through the hull into her palms. Recyclers humming. Atmosphere processors cycling. The ten thousand small mechanical processes that keep six people alive in the vacuum. She knows every one of them. She has always found comfort in that knowing.

Osen meets them at the shuttle bay with a medkit and a face carefully arranged to betray nothing. Dae runs full diagnostics on all three of them, finds nothing anomalous, and runs them twice more.

Remi makes tea. Poul starts dinner. The *Meridian* settles back into its routines with the ease of a body returning to a familiar chair — the hum of the recyclers, the smell of garlic in the ventilation, the wobble in the galley table that Dae's boot corrects without thinking. Nobody asks Naveli what she saw inside the Object. The official report will take days to write and will contain every reading, every measurement, every datum the *Gosling*'s instruments recorded. The forty-one minutes of silence at the center will appear in the report as a gap in the navigation log.

That evening, after Poul's fish and rice and the single lemon deployed as garnish over Naveli's half-hearted objections, she sits at the communications terminal in the *Meridian*'s small forward office. The room is quiet. Through the viewport, the Object is visible as a dark shape against the gas giant's glow — unchanged, unrevealing, patient.

She opens a message to Titan station. To Preet, specifically — her sister's contact, unchanged in nine years, still sitting in her address list between a parts supplier on Ganymede and a retired crew mate she never writes to either.

The words come slowly. She types *How is the garden* and deletes it. She types *I've been thinking about* and deletes that too. She does not mention the Object. She does not describe the interior or the central chamber or the silence. Those things will be in her official report, in language calibrated for mission control.

She sits for a long time with the cursor blinking in an empty field. Then she types: *Is the frangipani still alive?*

She stares at the four words. She does not send them. She does not delete them either. She saves the message as a draft and goes to bed, and the *Meridian* carries her through the dark the way it always has — steadily, without complaint, doing its work at the edge of where people live.

The Alcyone Object remains in orbit around Kepler-442c for another nineteen days. On the twentieth, without warning or acceleration visible to any instrument in the monitoring array, it is gone. Remi's sensor logs, when submitted to the Callisto Institute and analyzed over the following years, will reveal a detail no one noticed during the encounter. The Object's energy emissions — the faint, almost subliminal electromagnetic output recorded across forty years and two separate objects — describe, when plotted in three dimensions against time, a curve. The curve is smooth, asymptotic, and corresponds to no known natural phenomenon. Three independent research teams will confirm its mathematical validity. None will determine what it represents. The curve is still incomplete. Its projected terminus, if the pattern holds, lies approximately two hundred years in the future, at coordinates that correspond to no star, no planet, no catalogued body — only empty space, and whatever waits there, patient as a garden, for the pattern to close.
