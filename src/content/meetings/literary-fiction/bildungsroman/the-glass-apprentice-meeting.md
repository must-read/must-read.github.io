The room was on the third floor of a building near Russell Square, one of those London seminar rooms that universities lend out for visiting writers and then forget to heat properly. There was a long table, a window overlooking a plane tree that had lost most of its leaves, and a radiator that clicked at irregular intervals as though it were trying to join the conversation. Adichie had brought tea in a thermos from somewhere else, which suggested she had been in this building before and knew better than to trust its facilities. Ishiguro arrived with nothing, sat down, folded his hands, and waited.

I had my laptop open and a document full of notes that I was already beginning to suspect were the wrong notes.

"So," Adichie said, pouring tea into a cup she'd also brought. "Coming of age."

"Yes," Ishiguro said. "Though I'm not sure that's quite what interests me about it."

"What interests you?"

He thought for a moment. The radiator clicked. "The retrospective quality. The narrator looking back at something they didn't understand at the time. That gap between experience and comprehension. It's very large when you're young, and it never really closes, but you only notice it later, when you look back and realize you were standing in the middle of something and had no idea of its shape."

"That's memory," Adichie said. "That's your territory."

"It's everyone's territory. But yes, I'm drawn to the unreliability of it. Not dramatic unreliability, not the narrator who's lying to you. Something quieter. The narrator who's telling the truth as they remember it, and the truth as they remember it has been shaped by eleven years of telling the story to themselves. The distortions are honest distortions."

I said something about how the story might use that structurally -- the narrator flagging their own uncertainty, saying things like "I believe this happened in November, though it may have been later." Ishiguro nodded, but Adichie set her cup down.

"I want to be careful with that," she said. "Because the unreliable-memory narration can become a mannerism. It can become a way of hedging. The narrator says 'I'm not sure this happened exactly this way' and it gives them permission to be vague, and vagueness is the enemy of the specific, sensory, rooted detail that makes a reader believe they are in a place. If I'm writing about Lagos, I need you to smell the kerosene. I need you to hear the okadas. I need the suya to have groundnut dust on it. Those details are not optional. They are the argument."

"The argument for what?" I asked.

"For the reality of the world. For this being a story set in a specific place with specific food and specific sounds and specific light, and not a story that could be set anywhere. Too much literary fiction lives in a kind of placeless, timeless interiority. The narrator thinks and remembers and processes, and the physical world is wallpaper. I resist that."

Ishiguro didn't disagree, exactly. He tilted his head in a way that meant he was considering something. "I take your point about specificity. But there's a tension, isn't there? Between the sensory detail that grounds a scene and the narrator's admitted uncertainty about whether the detail is real. If the narrator says 'I remember the taste of groundnut dust on the suya, though this may be something I've added in retrospect' -- that's doing two things at once. It's giving you the sensation and undermining it. I find that very interesting."

"I find it evasive," Adichie said.

There was a pause. Outside, a bus went past on the street below and the window rattled slightly in its frame.

"Not evasive," Ishiguro said, with the quiet precision of someone correcting a student's essay. "Strategic. The reader gets the sensation regardless. The body responds to 'groundnut dust' whether the narrator is sure or not. But the admission of uncertainty creates an emotional register that pure confidence doesn't have. It says: this matters enough to me that I'm afraid of getting it wrong."

"Or it says: I'm more interested in the act of remembering than in what happened." Adichie poured more tea. "Which is a fine subject for fiction, but I want the thing that happened to be as vivid as the remembering of it. I want the workshop. I want the furnace and the glass and the woman teaching the girl. I want the mother who arranges everything. That woman is not an abstraction. She presses the school uniform each evening. She puts the vegetables at twelve o'clock on the plate. That is who she is. You know her through those gestures."

"I agree entirely," Ishiguro said, and he meant it, and the agreement landed with a kind of gravity that surprised me. "The mother arranging the plate is exactly right. Because the arrangement is the love. The arrangement is also the cage. And the character doesn't have to announce that. The reader sees the plate and understands."

I was scribbling, trying to keep up. "So the mother's control is expressed through domestic order -- the pressed uniforms, the silent house, the rules that aren't cruel but are suffocating. And the workshop is the opposite. Messy, loud, Fela Kuti on the radio, chin chin eaten with sticky fingers."

"Yes, but be careful with the binary," Adichie said. "Home equals repression, workshop equals freedom -- that's too clean. Too available. In Nigeria, a woman who keeps her house immaculate and her daughter disciplined is not simply a villain. She may be a woman who has survived things. Who has decided that control is the only form of safety she can provide. The discipline is sincere. The love inside it is real. If you make her a symbol of constraint, you have reduced her, and I will not write a reduced Nigerian mother."

That landed. I felt the wrongness of my own thinking -- how quickly I'd sorted the characters into liberating and constraining, and how much that flattened them.

"The mother has a secret," I said, trying a different angle. "Something about the father. About the connection between her and the glassblower. The daughter doesn't know, and the mother's silence is both protective and selfish."

"Not selfish," Ishiguro said. "Or not only selfish. This is what I keep returning to in my own work -- the character who withholds information not out of malice but out of a genuine belief that the withholding is a kindness. Stevens in *The Remains of the Day* doesn't express his feelings because he truly believes that restraint is dignity. He's wrong, but he's sincere. The mother here -- her silence about the father, about Nsukka, about whatever happened -- she believes the silence is an act of care. She has arranged the silence the way she arranges everything else. With love. With terrible, careful, suffocating love."

"And the glassblower disrupts it," Adichie said. She was leaning forward now. "Not deliberately. She doesn't set out to undermine the mother. But she tells stories. She mentions Nsukka. She says, 'You have his hands.' And each of those moments is a small crack in the wall the mother has built, and the daughter starts to see light through the cracks."

"Through the cracks," I repeated, thinking about glass, about fractures, about light bending in new directions.

"Don't overdo the glass metaphor," Adichie said, as though she could read the thought. "It's there. Glass is the story's material. But if every emotional moment is 'like glass,' the reader will want to throw something. Let the glass be glass. Let it be a trade, a skill, a thing you learn with your hands. Let it accumulate meaning through repetition and context, not through the narrator announcing the symbolism."

Ishiguro almost smiled. "That's exactly right. The best symbols are the ones the writer pretends not to notice. You describe the incalmo technique -- two colours of glass fused so the seam disappears -- and you let the reader make the connection to the two women, or to the daughter's dual inheritance, or to whatever it means to them. The moment you write 'I understood then that the glass was a metaphor for...' you have destroyed it."

"I wouldn't do that," I said, slightly defensive.

"You would be tempted," Ishiguro said. "Every writer is tempted to explain. The discipline is in the silence."

Adichie pushed back, gently. "But there's a difference between silence and withholding. I've read stories -- literary stories, prize-winning stories -- that are so committed to the unsaid that they become obscure. The reader finishes and thinks, 'Something happened, but I'm not sure what, and I'm not sure I care.' The restraint becomes a performance. It signals sophistication without delivering feeling. I would rather err on the side of clarity."

"And I would rather err on the side of trust," Ishiguro said. "Trust that the reader will feel what you haven't said."

"Your readers are willing to work for it. Not all readers are."

"That may be true. But the work of interpretation is what makes a story stay. The stories I remember most vividly are the ones where I had to do some of the feeling myself, where the text gave me enough to begin and left me to finish."

They looked at each other across the table, and neither blinked, and I realized this was not a disagreement that would resolve. This was the productive fault line -- Ishiguro's restraint against Adichie's luminous directness -- and the story would have to live on the seam between them.

I shifted to the question of the body. "The girl is learning a physical skill. Glassblowing is intensely physical -- the heat, the blisters, the muscle memory. I want that to be central. The body as the site of learning, but also as the site of inherited identity. She has her father's hands. She doesn't know that yet, but her body knows something her mind doesn't."

"Good," Adichie said. "And the body is also where culture lives. The way the girl sits, the way she says 'Yes, ma,' the way she eats with her right hand -- those are Nigerian specificities, not generalizable 'coming of age' gestures. Don't smooth them out. Don't explain them. If a reader doesn't know what chin chin is, they can look it up, or they can understand from context that it is food eaten from a plastic bag, which tells them everything they need to know about its informality."

"The body is also where the constraint lives," Ishiguro added. "The mother's house -- the silence, the held breath, the not-shouting. Those are physical disciplines. The girl has been trained in stillness. And then the workshop asks her body to do something different. To move, to breathe into the pipe, to feel the glass. The apprenticeship is a physical rebellion before it's an intellectual one."

I tried something. "What if the revelation isn't dramatic? What if the mother tells the daughter the truth about the father and the glassblower -- that they were married, that there's this whole hidden history -- and the daughter's reaction is almost muted? She sits with it. She doesn't scream or cry or run out. Because she's been trained in that restraint. The mother's discipline has shaped her so thoroughly that even the shattering news is received quietly."

Ishiguro leaned back. "Yes. That interests me enormously. The devastation that arrives quietly. The character who has been so conditioned to suppress that the suppression itself becomes the tragedy. She cannot feel it fully, not in the moment. She feels it later, in retrospect, through the glass of memory, and even then she's not sure what she felt."

"But she does feel it," Adichie said firmly. "She has to feel it. I don't want a character so repressed that she's opaque. She can be restrained in how she expresses it, but the reader must know the ground has shifted. She sits with the news 'the way you sit with a piece of glass that has just come out of the furnace -- you cannot touch it, you can only wait for it to cool enough to hold.' That's restraint and feeling at once. That's what I want."

"Did you just write a sentence?" I said.

"I occasionally write sentences, yes."

Ishiguro almost laughed. The radiator clicked three times rapidly, as if applauding.

"There's something about the ending that worries me," I said. "The risk of resolution. The reader wants to know: did the glassblower love the girl for herself, or for the ghost of the child she lost? Did the mother send the girl to the workshop out of generosity or penance? And I think the honest answer is that it's both, and it's neither, and the girl will never fully know."

"That's the right instinct," Ishiguro said. "Don't answer it. The ambiguity is not a failure of the story. It's the subject of the story. The girl grows up and she has these two women who shaped her, and the truth of their motives is beyond reach. Not because it's hidden. Because motives are never singular. Every human action is overdetermined. The mother acted out of love, guilt, control, generosity, and penance simultaneously, and none of those cancels the others out."

"I agree," Adichie said, "but the story has to end somewhere. It has to land. I don't mean resolution -- I don't mean tying a bow. I mean the last paragraph should leave the reader with a sensation, not a question. A feeling in the body, not an idea in the head."

"A feeling of what?"

She considered this. "Of glass. Of holding something up to the light and seeing colour inside it that you didn't expect. Of two things fused so completely you can't tell where one ends and the other begins. That's the technique she learns -- the incalmo. Two bubbles joined. And it's the technique of the story, too, isn't it? Two women joined in this girl. Two pasts. Two kinds of love. The seam invisible."

"That's the ending," I said. "Not the image, not exactly. But that feeling. The girl holds the glass to the light and sees the amber inside the clear, and she understands something she can't articulate. And the reader feels it with her."

Ishiguro was quiet for a moment. "I would only add: she should also not understand something. The understanding should be partial. She grasps that the glass is more than glass, and she grasps that the workshop was more than a workshop, but the full meaning is still cooling. She can't hold it yet. Maybe she never will."

"And that's where you two part ways," I said, realizing it as I said it. "Chimamanda, you want the reader to feel it in the body -- a sensation, complete and present. Kazuo, you want the reader to feel the incompleteness -- the thing that's still beyond reach. And the story has to do both."

"The story has to try," Ishiguro corrected. "Whether it succeeds is another question."

Adichie wrapped her hands around her thermos cup. "Let me tell you something about the mother. The mother who arranges everything. She is not my mother, but she is many mothers I knew growing up in Nsukka. Women who survived the civil war, or whose mothers survived it, and who learned that the world is not safe and the only defence is order. When I write her, I write her with that knowledge. She is not repressive because she is cold. She is repressive because she has seen what happens when things fall apart. The press of the uniform, the silence at dinner, the vegetables at twelve o'clock -- those are fortifications. She is holding the world together by sheer force of arrangement. And she is exhausted by it, though she will never say so."

Nobody spoke for a moment. The plane tree outside moved in a wind we couldn't feel.

"That's who she is," Adichie said. "And she deserves a story that knows that."

I thought about the photograph -- the one the daughter finds on the workshop wall, the two women holding hands in front of a church, her mother smiling in a way the daughter has never seen. That photograph is the crack. It shows the mother before the fortifications went up. Before the arranging began. And the daughter sees it and knows, without being told, that her mother was once a different person. That the control is not who she is. It's who she became.

"There's something else," Ishiguro said, and his voice had shifted slightly, the way it does when he's circling something he hasn't fully thought through. "The glassblower's letter at the end. If there is a letter. 'The glass remembers what we teach it.' That's a beautiful line, but it's also slightly terrifying, isn't it? Because what was she teaching the girl? Not just a craft. She was teaching her a way of being -- attentive, patient, willing to work with a material that punishes hesitation. And she was doing it for reasons the girl couldn't know. The girl thought she was learning glass. She was learning something else. And she still doesn't know, fully, what it was."

"That's the question the story leaves open," I said.

"One of them," Adichie said. "The other is whether knowing would change anything. She has the skill. She has the memory. She has whatever was passed to her through the hands her father also had. Whether the glassblower's motives were pure or complicated or some impossible mixture of love and grief -- the girl still has what she was given. The glass doesn't care why it was shaped. It only knows the hands that shaped it."

Ishiguro opened his mouth to respond, then closed it. He looked out the window at the bare plane tree, and I thought he might say something about the English weather, or about needing to leave, but instead he said, very quietly, "I think the story might be about the difference between understanding and knowing. She comes to understand, over the years, what happened between these two women and her father. But knowing -- really knowing, the way you know heat on your skin or the weight of glass on a pipe -- that kind of knowing might be beyond her. And the ache of the story is in that gap."

Adichie nodded slowly. "And the body of the story -- the glass, the furnace, the workshop on Balogun Street -- that's where the knowing lives. Not in the retrospection. In the hands."

The radiator gave a final, emphatic click and went silent. Adichie began screwing the cap back on her thermos. Ishiguro straightened the cuffs of his jacket, a gesture so precise and habitual that I thought of the mother, arranging things, and I wondered if he noticed the parallel, and I decided not to ask.

I closed my laptop. My notes were a mess. But somewhere in the mess was a girl at a furnace, and two women who loved the same man and then, impossibly, loved the same child, and the question of what glass remembers, and the feeling of amber light blooming inside something clear, and I thought: that's enough. That's where the story begins.
