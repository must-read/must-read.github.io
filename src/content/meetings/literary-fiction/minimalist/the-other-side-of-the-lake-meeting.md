The café was almost empty. Late afternoon, a Tuesday. Rain against the windows. Hemingway had chosen the place — a bar, really, that served coffee in the mornings and afternoons if you asked. The kind of establishment that does not announce itself. Dark wood. A few tables. He sat with his back to the wall, which I had read he liked to do, and which I believed because it seemed right.

Ishiguro arrived ten minutes late, apologizing quietly. He hung his coat on the back of his chair and sat down and looked at the table as though taking inventory of what was on it. A glass. A napkin. The grain of the wood.

"I walked," he said. "I should have taken a cab."

"Walking is better," Hemingway said.

I had my notebook open. I closed it. The notebook made me feel like a student, which I was, but there is a difference between being a student and looking like one.

We ordered. Hemingway had whiskey. Ishiguro had tea. I had coffee, which felt like a compromise and probably was.

"So," Hemingway said. "A story about a lake."

"A story set at a lake," Ishiguro said. "That's different."

Hemingway looked at him. "Is it."

"A story about a lake would be about the lake. The water, the shore, the weather on it. A story set at a lake uses the lake as — I don't want to say backdrop. That's reductive. But the lake is the container. The story is what's inside."

"The lake is both," Hemingway said. "That's the whole trick. You describe the lake and the reader feels what you haven't described. The lake does the work."

I said something about pathetic fallacy. I regretted it immediately.

Hemingway didn't respond to that. He drank from his glass and set it down and said, "I wrote a story once about two people at a train station. They're waiting for a train. They talk about the hills. They talk about drinks. They never say what they're really talking about. The reader knows anyway. The reader knows because of what they don't say."

"I've read it," Ishiguro said. "It's very good."

"It's good because it trusts the reader. Most writers don't trust the reader. They think they have to explain. They put up signs. Here is the meaning. Here is what you should feel."

"I agree with the principle," Ishiguro said. "But I think what you're describing — the omission, the iceberg — works differently depending on what's underneath. In your story, the thing underneath is specific. It's a decision. The reader can name it. In what I tend to write, the thing underneath is something the narrator can't name either. The narrator is circling it, the way you circle something in a dark room. You know it's there. You bump against it. But you can't quite see its shape."

Hemingway considered this. "That's two different kinds of silence."

"Yes."

"Mine is the silence of someone who won't speak. Yours is the silence of someone who can't."

Ishiguro smiled, barely. "I think that's right. And I think this story might need both."

This is the moment when I should have been taking notes, but I was listening. The rain had gotten heavier. The bartender was reading a newspaper behind the bar, the real kind, printed on paper. The café smelled like wet coats and something underneath — woodsmoke, maybe, from another day.

"Tell me about the couple," Hemingway said. He was looking at me now.

I told them what I had. A man and a woman, married a long time. They go to a cabin they've been going to for years. A lake. October. Something has happened — something involving their daughter — and they are there together and they are not talking about it.

"What happened to the daughter?" Hemingway said.

"She disappeared."

"Dead?"

"They don't know."

Hemingway was quiet for a moment. Then: "That's worse."

Ishiguro leaned forward. "That's the whole engine. Not knowing. Because if she's dead, they grieve. That's terrible but it has a shape. You can hold it. You know what you're carrying. But if she might be alive somewhere, might walk through a door tomorrow or might never — that's a grief that won't sit still. It changes shape every day."

"The ambiguity is the wound," I said, and it sounded too neat, and Ishiguro's slight hesitation confirmed it.

"The ambiguity is the condition," he said. "Not the wound. The wound is whatever happened before she left. The wound is that they saw it happening and chose not to see it. That's what interests me — how people participate in their own loss. Not out of malice. Out of love, almost. They loved the version of their life where everything was fine, so they maintained it."

"Complicity," Hemingway said.

"A gentle word for it. But yes."

I asked Hemingway what he thought the story should look like on the page. How it should move.

"Short sentences," he said. "Declarative. The man is telling you what happened. He carried the bags. She made the beds. He fixed the dock. These are facts. The facts carry weight because of what sits between them. The weight is in the white space."

"But he's also remembering," Ishiguro said. "He's narrating from some distance. He's looking back at this weekend and trying to understand what it meant, and the looking-back changes what he sees. Memory is an editor. It cuts. It rearranges. A man remembering his daughter learning to swim — he's not reporting. He's reconstructing. And the reconstruction tells you more about where he is now than where he was then."

Hemingway shook his head. Not disagreeing, exactly. Resisting. "If you get too far into the memory, you lose the present. The cabin, the lake, the dock with the loose board. These things have to be real. The reader has to feel the nail going in. If you float up into retrospection, it all becomes vapor."

"I don't think retrospection is vapor," Ishiguro said, his voice perfectly level. "I think it's another kind of landscape. The narrator walks through it the way he walks through the woods. He's physically somewhere — on a trail, beside a lake — but he's also somewhere in time, and the two places overlap. I think you can hold both."

"You can. If you keep the prose clean."

"We agree on that."

"We agree on the prose. We disagree on how much room the narrator gets to think."

This was true and I could feel the tension in it, productive but real. Hemingway wanted the story on the surface — action, dialogue, physical detail — with the meaning submerged. Ishiguro wanted the narrator's mind to be part of the surface, wanted the circling and the digression to be visible to the reader, wanted you to watch the narrator trying and failing to get to the thing he needs to say.

"What if both?" I said. "What if the present tense — the cabin, the weekend — is told Hemingway's way? Clean. Declarative. Pine needles on the porch, the dock, the pasta with olives. And then the narrator starts remembering, starts going around the thing he can't say, and the prose shifts. Not dramatically. But the sentences get longer. He digresses. He talks about Laura learning to swim and he can't describe Helen's face and the inability is the point."

Hemingway looked at his glass. "That could work. If you don't announce the shift. If you don't put up a sign that says, now we are in memory. The reader should feel it the way you feel a current change in the water."

"And the narrator should not know he's doing it," Ishiguro said. "He should think he's being straightforward. He should tell you, I want to be precise about what happened. And then he should fail to be precise, and the failure should be where the story lives."

"A man who can't say the thing," Hemingway said.

"A man who keeps starting to say the thing and then tells you about the dock instead."

Hemingway smiled at that. It was small and it was gone quickly. "I know that man."

The bartender brought another whiskey without being asked, which told me something about how often Hemingway came here, or at least about the kind of places he gravitates toward — places where the bartender learns what you drink and brings it before you have to ask, which is its own form of silence.

"The wife," Ishiguro said. "Helen. She concerns me."

"Why?"

"Because in this kind of story — a married couple, a shared grief — there's a temptation to make them both circling the same thing in the same way. Mirror images. He won't talk about it, she won't talk about it, they hold hands in the dark. It's symmetrical and it's a lie. Real couples in grief — they grieve differently. They're in different rooms of the same house."

"She's more organized," I said. "She knows where the sheets are. She drives. She makes the sandwiches. She's not circling. She's managing. That's her version of not talking about it."

"Good," Ishiguro said. "But she also needs to crack. Just once. Just enough that you see through."

"On the trail," Hemingway said. He said it like he was remembering something, not proposing it. "They walk around the lake. She's ahead of him. She says something about the daughter walking somewhere. She imagines her daughter walking."

"That's the crack," Ishiguro said.

"It's not a crack. It's a window. She opens it and then she closes it. But you've seen through."

I wrote this down. Helen on the trail. Her back. The blue jacket. The sentence about imagining Laura walking. I could feel the scene already, the way she would say it without turning around, because saying it to his face would make it too real.

"And then she asks him," Ishiguro said. "Whether he believes their daughter is all right."

"He can't answer that."

"He answers it badly. He says something true that is also a deflection. She knows it. He knows she knows it."

"Do you believe it? — I believe she's somewhere." Hemingway said this flat, almost to himself. Testing the dialogue. "That's a sentence that means nothing and everything."

We sat with that for a while. The rain had slowed. I could hear it, individual drops now instead of the continuous sound. The bartender folded his newspaper.

"They don't complete the walk," I said. "They turn back."

"Why?" Hemingway said.

"Because finishing the loop means arriving somewhere. Going back means returning to what they know. They're not ready to arrive anywhere new."

Ishiguro nodded. "That's the ending, isn't it. Not an ending, really. They go back to the cabin. They pack. They drive home. She says same time next month. The story closes on the road, the lake disappearing behind the trees."

"No resolution," Hemingway said.

"There can't be," Ishiguro said. "Resolution would be obscene. Their daughter is gone and they don't know where and they may never know. Any ending that resolves that is a lie."

"The ending resolves nothing," I said. "But it's not hopeless, either. She says I want. That's something. She wants to come back. That's a decision. It's small but it's real."

"Don't oversell it," Hemingway said. "If you undersell it, the reader feels it. If you oversell it, the reader doesn't trust you. She says she wants to come back and that's all. No reflection on what it means. No narrator explaining why this matters. She says it and then they drive and the story ends."

"The story ends," Ishiguro said, "but the silence continues. The reader leaves the story carrying the silence with them. That's what this kind of fiction does. It doesn't deliver you anywhere. It leaves you standing where the characters stood, listening to what they couldn't say."

Hemingway finished his whiskey. He put the glass down carefully, the way you put down something that matters and something that doesn't — the same gesture, equally precise.

"There's one thing," he said. "The dock."

"What about the dock?"

"He fixes it. Saturday morning. One loose board, two nails pulled free, soft wood underneath. He fixes it and while he's working he doesn't think about his daughter. That's the truest thing in the story. A man doing simple work with his hands because the work requires attention and attention is the only way he can stop thinking, and he doesn't admit that to himself, which makes it more true."

"And you'll check the dock again before they leave," Ishiguro said.

"He checks it. The board holds. The nails are good."

"That's not about the dock."

"Of course it's not about the dock. But you never say that. You never say, the dock represents. The dock is a dock. It's also everything else. But on the page, it's a dock."

Ishiguro picked up his teacup, which was empty. He held it for a moment and put it down. "I think we're circling the same question from different directions. How much should the narrator understand about what he's doing? How conscious is his avoidance?"

"He's conscious enough to know he's going around it," I said. "He says so. He says, I keep going around it. Helen tells me I do this. But knowing you're doing it doesn't mean you can stop."

"That's Ishiguro's territory," Hemingway said. It wasn't a concession. It was an acknowledgment. A man who knows he is failing to speak and speaks about the failure — that is closer to what Ishiguro does. Hemingway's characters don't narrate their own evasions. They just evade.

"But the prose is yours," Ishiguro said. "The sentences. Short, declarative, load-bearing. I couldn't write this story in my voice. My voice would make it too interior, too meditative. This narrator needs your economy. He needs to say, the lake was there. He needs the period at the end."

Hemingway nodded. "And then he needs your digressions. The daughter swimming. Helen's face that he can't describe. The phone calls that got shorter. These are your insertions. They break the surface. But they should feel like they belong to the same voice."

"One voice," I said. "Two modes."

"Don't make it a formula," Hemingway said. "Don't think about it that way. Think about a man sitting on a porch after his wife has gone inside. He's looking at a lake. The lake is dark. He can't see it. But he knows it's there because he has seen it before. That sentence does everything. It's about the lake. It's about his daughter. It's about the life he used to have. And it says none of that. It says: the lake was out there but you could not see it. You could only know it was there because you had seen it before."

Ishiguro was quiet for a moment. Outside, a car passed in the rain, its headlights moving across the window and gone.

"You know what troubles me," he said, not quite to either of us. "How easy it is. Looking away. He describes it in the story — they saw the signs and called them something else. Independence. Growing up. The natural order. I've written about this. Characters who know the truth and choose not to look at it. But this is different because the stakes are a child. Their child. And still they looked away. Not because they didn't love her. Because they loved their life more than they loved the truth about their life."

He stopped. The bartender was wiping down the far end of the bar. The rain had nearly stopped.

"That's the cruelest line in the story," Ishiguro said. "We loved it more than we loved the truth. And by the time we were willing to love the truth instead, the truth was an empty apartment and a phone that rang and rang."

"I haven't written it yet," I said.

"No. But that's where it goes. That's where it has to go."

Hemingway stood up. He put money on the table, more than enough. He looked at me, then at Ishiguro.

"Write it clean," he said. "Write it so clean that when you're done, a person reads it and they feel like they've been punched in the stomach and they can't point to the sentence that did it. Every sentence is simple. Every sentence is true. And the thing that hurts is nowhere on the page."

He left. The door closed behind him. The café was quieter without him in it, the way a room is quieter when something has been removed that you didn't realize was making sound.

Ishiguro sat for a moment longer. He turned his teacup in its saucer, one slow rotation.

"He's right about the prose," he said. "But the narrator — let him circle. Let him try to arrive at the thing and fail and try again. That's not weakness. That's accuracy. That's what it actually feels like to carry something you can't put down."

He stood up and put on his coat.

"One more thing," he said. "The walk around the lake. When they turn back instead of completing the circle. Don't explain it. Don't have the narrator say, we turned back because we weren't ready. Just have them turn back. The reader will know."

"Hemingway would agree with that," I said.

"Yes," Ishiguro said. "That's the part where we agree. The parts where we agree are small. But they're the parts that matter."

He left. I sat in the café with my notebook still closed and my coffee cold and the rain nearly stopped outside. I could hear the last of it on the windows, individual drops, each one its own small sound against the glass. I thought about a man on a porch. A lake he couldn't see. A daughter who might be walking somewhere. I opened my notebook and I did not write anything because the story was not in the notebook yet. It was in the space between what Hemingway said and what Ishiguro said, in the silence that both of them, in their different ways, had insisted was the point.
