We met in a faculty office that didn't belong to any of us. Third floor of a humanities building at a university I won't name, somewhere in the American Midwest, one of those campuses where the buildings are brick and the parking lots are enormous and the sky starts about four feet above your head and never stops. The office had been lent to us by someone in the philosophy department who was on sabbatical. There were books on shelves that hadn't been touched in months, a dead plant on the windowsill, and a coffee machine that made sounds like a radiator. I mention these details because Knausgaard noticed them first, all of them, and because McCarthy would later argue that the dead plant was more interesting as a system than as an image.

Knausgaard sat in the office chair behind the desk, which I thought was presumptuous until I realized he simply hadn't thought about it -- he'd walked in, seen a chair, sat down. McCarthy took the wooden chair by the door, the one clearly meant for students during office hours. I sat on the windowsill next to the dead plant, which put me slightly above both of them and made me self-conscious about it for the entire conversation.

"The man changes a semicolon," Knausgaard said. He'd read my notes on the story. "That's the opening. He changes a semicolon."

"To a period," I said. "And then back."

"Yes." He leaned forward. "This is exactly right. Because the drama of punctuation is real -- it's not a metaphor for drama, it *is* drama, the actual thing, the decision about how two ideas relate to each other, and when you've been making that decision for twenty-two years about the same manuscript, the semicolon contains your entire life. Everything you've chosen and refused to choose. The indecision is the autobiography."

McCarthy crossed his legs. He was wearing dark trousers and a dark shirt and looked, as he always does, like someone who has thought carefully about looking like someone who hasn't thought about what they're wearing. "The semicolon is interesting," he said, "but not for the reasons you think. It's interesting as a relay. A switching mechanism. The character isn't agonizing over meaning -- he's tuning a frequency. The semicolon is a different frequency than the period. They transmit different signals. What matters isn't how he feels about it. What matters is how the system behaves."

"The system," Knausgaard said, and his tone carried something I recognized from his books, a kind of flat patience that is also stubbornness. "The system is a man sitting alone at six in the morning in an office that smells of old coffee. The system is his hands on the keyboard. The system is twenty-two years."

"Exactly. Twenty-two years of a feedback loop processing its own output. The manuscript that grows toward incompleteness rather than completion. That's a machine. A beautiful one. The question is whether we write it from inside the machine or from a position where we can see the machine's architecture."

I said something then about wanting both -- the inside and the architecture -- and they both looked at me the way you look at someone who has proposed solving a territorial dispute by suggesting both countries are nice.

"You can't have both," McCarthy said. "Interiority and structural awareness are mutually exclusive perspectives. The moment you zoom out to see the system, you've left the character's consciousness. And the moment you're inside the character's consciousness, the system is invisible to him. That's the whole point. The fish doesn't see the water."

"The fish sees the water," Knausgaard said. "The fish sees nothing *but* the water. The problem is that the fish has learned to describe the water in the language of marine biology instead of the language of drowning."

That was good. I wrote it down. McCarthy saw me writing it down and said, "Don't use that."

"Why not?"

"Because it resolves into an aphorism. And aphorisms are the enemy of this kind of fiction. The character we're discussing -- this professor with his endless manuscript -- he is someone for whom no thought has ever resolved into an aphorism. That's his pathology. He can't stop qualifying. Every period is a lie he isn't willing to tell."

Knausgaard was quiet for a moment. The coffee machine made a sound like a small animal in distress. Through the window behind me I could see the parking lot, flat and gray, with a few cars scattered across it in no discernible pattern.

"I want to talk about the student," Knausgaard said. "The former student who publishes the book. Because this is where it gets -- this is where the story finds its body, I think. The shame of it. Not the intellectual betrayal, not the philosophical disagreement about how to handle the argument. The shame. The physical experience of seeing someone younger take the thing you spent your life on and do it better. Or not better -- differently. Do it *at all*. When you couldn't."

"The student isn't doing the same thing," McCarthy said.

"Of course he is."

"He's not. The professor's manuscript is a system that maintains itself. The student's book is a product. They share subject matter the way a radio telescope and a pair of binoculars share the sky. The professor hasn't failed to do what the student did. He's done something else entirely. The question the story has to sit with is whether that something else has value -- whether a signal that never reaches a receiver is still a signal."

I asked whether we were talking about communication theory or about loneliness.

"I'm talking about communication theory," McCarthy said.

"I'm talking about loneliness," Knausgaard said, and there was a moment where we all three recognized the difference and nobody tried to resolve it, which felt like progress.

Knausgaard stood up and went to the window. He looked at the parking lot the way he looks at parking lots in his books -- with the full attention you're supposed to reserve for sunsets or great paintings, the democratic gaze that treats everything as equally worthy of sustained observation. "The professor lives in Iowa," he said. "He drives to campus in the dark. He drinks coffee from a mug with a chipped handle. He's been doing this for thirty years. These details are not setting. They are the story. The chipped handle is the story. The morning light on salt crystals in a parking lot is the story. Because what does it mean to devote your life to an idea about contrarianism while living the most un-contrary life imaginable? A life of routine, of solitude, of small repetitive gestures? The semicolon gets changed to a period. The period gets changed back. The coffee gets spilled. The coffee stain gets covered with journals. This is a life. This is what a life actually looks like when nobody is watching."

"That's the Stoner problem," I said, because I'd been thinking about it, about how John Williams had done something similar -- the quiet arc of an academic life told in the most unsparing terms, where the devastation comes not from catastrophe but from the accumulation of days that looked, from outside, like nothing.

"Williams is too clean," McCarthy said. "Stoner has a shape. Beginning, middle, end. The life is given retrospective coherence by the novel's structure. Our character should resist that. The manuscript resists it -- the manuscript that grows toward incompleteness is a rejection of the Stoner arc. It says: I will not become legible. I will not let you summarize my life in your devastating opening paragraph."

"But we have to write the story," I said. "At some point we have to commit to sentences that make a shape."

"Yes," McCarthy said. "And the tension between the character's refusal to commit and our commitment to writing about his refusal -- that's the engine. The story is a machine for thinking about why this man cannot finish a machine for thinking."

Knausgaard turned from the window. "You keep saying machine."

"You keep saying shame."

"Because shame is what makes it fiction instead of philosophy. The moment at the conference when the student sees the professor in the back row. That fraction of a second when the rhythm breaks. When the signal stutters. Whatever you want to call it. That's the story's center. Not the argument about contrarianism, not the feedback loop -- the look. One man recognizing another across a room and both of them knowing that something has been taken and something has been given and the transaction is irreversible."

"I don't disagree about the conference scene," McCarthy said. "But the look isn't psychological. It's a disruption in transmission. The student is broadcasting -- he's at a podium, he's performing, he's transmitting signal to a room -- and the presence of the professor introduces noise. The professor is noise. He's the interference pattern in the student's clean signal. And the student knows it, and the professor knows it, and neither of them can say what that knowledge means because it exists at a frequency below the threshold of language."

I was caught between them. The story I was beginning to see had both of these things in it -- the hot confessional weight of Knausgaard's vision and the cold structural beauty of McCarthy's -- and I couldn't figure out how to make them coexist without one canceling the other.

"What about the potters?" I said.

They both looked at me.

"I've been thinking about including another thread. A colleague who studies Neolithic ceramics. A pottery tradition that existed for four hundred years alongside the dominant culture and then just stopped. Not because it was defeated. The knowledge simply wasn't passed on. One generation knew how to make the pots and the next didn't."

Knausgaard's face changed. Something opened in it. "That's devastating," he said.

"That's a perfect analogy for a signal that degrades over time," McCarthy said.

"It's not an analogy," Knausgaard said. "It's a parallel. It's another person living the same thing. A woman who spent years studying something nobody else cares about, and she's not ashamed of it, she's not tortured by it, she just does it. She pours sugar into her coffee with precision and talks about pottery techniques that vanished four thousand years ago and she is completely at peace with the obscurity of her subject."

"Is she, though?" I said. "Or is she just better at it?"

"Better at what?"

"At being unread. At transmitting on a frequency no one's tuned to receive."

There was a silence. McCarthy picked up a pen from the desk and turned it over in his fingers, examining it as though it were an artifact. "The Bolano element," he said. "The Savage Detectives. You haven't mentioned it."

He was right. I'd been thinking about *The Savage Detectives* the way you think about a problem you can't quite name -- the book's obsession with literary movements that burn themselves out, with poets who vanish into the desert, with the impossibility of genuine artistic rebellion. The visceral realists who believed in something so fiercely that the belief consumed its own fuel.

"The professor's manuscript is a visceral realist project," I said, trying the thought out loud. "Twenty-two years of absolute commitment to an idea, and the commitment itself has become the subject, has eaten the original argument, has turned into a self-sustaining system that exists for its own sake."

"A fire that forgot what it was burning for," Knausgaard said.

McCarthy looked at the ceiling. "That's not bad."

"Don't patronize me."

"I'm not. It's genuinely not bad. But the danger is sentimentality. The danger is that we write a story about a noble failure, a man too principled to publish, too devoted to his idea to compromise it. That's a comfortable narrative. It lets the reader admire him from a safe distance."

"So what's the alternative?" I asked.

"The alternative is that we never decide. Whether his obscurity is principled or cowardly. Whether the manuscript is a masterpiece or an elaborate avoidance mechanism. Whether the student rescued the idea or stole it. The story holds the question open and refuses to answer it. Not as a postmodern gesture. As an honest admission that some questions about a life can only be answered by the person living it, and he hasn't answered it either."

"That's what I've been saying," Knausgaard said, and there was irritation in his voice, the real kind, the kind that comes from recognizing your own idea in someone else's language. "That's exactly what the confessional mode does. It says: here is everything I know, and here is the place where knowing stops, and I will not pretend that the narrative has access to certainties the narrator doesn't."

"The confessional mode pretends to be honest," McCarthy said. "It performs honesty. The accumulation of physical detail -- the chipped mug, the coffee stain, the salt on the parking lot -- these are rhetorical devices. They create the *effect* of radical honesty. But no amount of sensory detail can make a text transparent. The text is a medium. It has its own properties. It distorts the signal."

"Everything distorts the signal. You live inside a body. The body distorts everything. That doesn't mean you stop trying to describe what the body feels."

I thought McCarthy would push back, but he didn't. He put the pen down. He looked at the dead plant on the windowsill beside me.

"NGC 399," he said quietly.

"What?"

"A galaxy described in three words. 'Very faint, small, round.' The entire output of nineteenth-century astronomical observation of an object containing billions of stars, reduced to three adjectives. That should be in the story."

"Why?"

"Because it's the opposite of what the professor does. He writes fourteen hundred pages about one idea. Dreyer wrote three words about a galaxy. And neither one is wrong. They're just different frequencies. Different bandwidths. The story should hold both -- the man who can't stop qualifying and the catalog entry that said everything it needed to say before the sentence was over."

Knausgaard sat back down. He looked tired, or not tired exactly, but like someone who has been paying attention with full intensity for too long and needs to stop. "The ending," he said. "The ending has to be him going back to the manuscript. Changing the semicolon. Changing it back. Not because the story is circular -- I'm not interested in structural neatness -- but because that's what he would actually do. He would go home. He would sit at his desk. He would change the punctuation mark. That's what a life in ideas looks like when you strip everything else away. A man and a choice between two marks on a page, and the choice never gets made, and the not-making is the whole of it."

"The story ends in not-making," McCarthy said.

"The story ends in a radiator ticking," Knausgaard said.

I waited for one of them to win. Neither of them did. The coffee machine made its sound again. Through the window the sky was the gray of institutional ceilings, flat and even, stretching to a horizon that was not visible but that you knew was there, a long way off, where the flatness of the land met the flatness of the sky and the difference between them was a matter of frequency and nothing else.

McCarthy said, "There's a version of this where the porch scene at the end -- the eleven minutes of sitting and not thinking -- is the most important passage. Because it's the only moment where the character stops processing. The machine pauses. And what's left when the machine pauses is just weather and time and the body sitting in a chair, and the prose should register that as a kind of -- I don't know the right word."

"Relief," Knausgaard said.

"No. Something colder. Something that doesn't have a name."

Knausgaard picked up his coffee, which had gone cold, and drank it anyway. "You're always looking for the thing that doesn't have a name," he said. "That's your whole project. The gap, the static, the interference pattern, the noise between frequencies. And I'm always trying to name everything, every sensation, every object in the room, every feeling however small or embarrassing. We're the same problem from different directions."

McCarthy didn't answer that. He stood up and put on his coat, which he'd draped over the back of his chair, and the gesture was so ordinary and so final that it functioned as a kind of punctuation -- not a period, not a semicolon, but the space at the bottom of a page before you turn to the next one, the blankness that means: this part is over, and what comes next will be different, and you won't know how until you're in it.
