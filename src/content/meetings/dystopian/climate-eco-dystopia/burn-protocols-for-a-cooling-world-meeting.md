The building had been a county extension office. You could tell because of the pamphlet racks bolted to the walls, still holding leaflets about soil pH testing and backyard composting, the paper going brown at the edges. Someone had pushed two metal desks together in the middle of the front room to make a conference table. The overhead fluorescent was out on one side, so half the room was washed in that institutional blue-white and the other half was just the late-afternoon sun coming through windows that hadn't been cleaned in a year. The haze outside was from the fires in the Sangre de Cristos. Not close enough to evacuate over, but close enough that everything had that sepia quality, like looking at the day through old varnish.

I'd set out water bottles. Three of them. It seemed like the right gesture for a conversation about a world running out of water — a small obscenity, room-temperature Dasani on a metal desk in a building that used to tell farmers how to irrigate.

El Akkad arrived first. He came in without ceremony, set a leather bag on the floor, and sat down in one of the plastic chairs as though he'd been assigned to it. He looked at the pamphlet rack. He looked at the water bottles. He did not say anything about either. He took out a notebook and a pen — a real pen, the kind you fill from a bottle — and opened the notebook to a page that already had writing on it. I couldn't read it from where I sat, but I could see the handwriting was small and level, the kind that comes from years of taking notes in places where you weren't sure you'd be allowed to stay.

Bradbury was late. Not very late. Maybe ten minutes. He came in through the wrong door — the side entrance, the one that opened onto a parking lot with two dead junipers — and he was carrying a paper bag from a bakery that I'm fairly certain didn't exist within forty miles. He set the bag on the desk and said, "They had bear claws. Actual bear claws. With the almonds. I haven't seen these since — well. Since before."

"Before what?" El Akkad said.

"Before everything started tasting like it was apologizing for itself." Bradbury sat down and pushed the bag toward the center of the desk. "Eat. Both of you. I can't talk about the end of the world on an empty stomach."

I took one. The almonds were good. I said so, and Bradbury waved me off. He was already looking around the room with the kind of attention that made me feel like I was watching someone photograph it with his eyes — the dead fluorescent, the pamphlet rack, the film of brown dust on the window sill. Taking inventory of the ruin.

"This is the right place for this conversation," he said. "A building that used to help people grow things."

"That's too neat," El Akkad said. He said it without meanness. A weather observation.

"It's an observation, not a metaphor. I'm observing that we're sitting in a dead agricultural office and we're about to discuss a story in which the government burns knowledge for heat. The irony isn't my invention. It was here when we arrived."

El Akkad conceded this with a nod that moved about three millimeters. Then he said: "Tell me what you see. The story. The shape of it."

I started talking. I said I saw a girl — young, maybe nine or ten at the start — displaced by water collapse in the Southwest. Climate refugees processed through federal camps. A protocol that authorizes the burning of paper materials for heating fuel. The books go first, then the government documents, and what the girl discovers is that they're not just burning fuel. They're burning the evidence that the collapse was predicted and ignored.

"How old when she discovers this?" El Akkad asked.

"Eleven. Maybe twelve."

"Good. Old enough to understand what she's reading. Young enough that the understanding changes the shape of her bones." He wrote something in his notebook. "The camp — you said federal. Which means intake forms. Processing. Ration classifications."

"Yes."

"I want to see those forms. Not described. Reproduced. The actual paperwork. Evacuee name, prior residence, water ration class. And in the notes field — someone has flagged her books for future reclamation. A casual annotation. Twenty-two words that seal the fate of her library, and whoever wrote them probably did it between two other forms and didn't think about it again."

"The bureaucratic detail," I said.

"Not detail. The bureaucratic *fact*. There's a difference. Detail is decoration. Fact is the mechanism. I covered refugee camps for years, and the thing that stays with you isn't the suffering — suffering is so large you can't hold it in your head for more than a few minutes at a time. What stays is the paperwork. The form that asks a woman who's lost her home and her husband to rate her satisfaction with the intake process on a scale of one to five. The check box. The classification system. These are the instruments of the catastrophe, and they look exactly like the instruments of ordinary life, and that resemblance is the horror."

Bradbury had been quiet through this. Not the performative quiet of someone waiting for their turn. Something else — a stillness that had a temperature to it, like a room where someone has just stopped shouting.

"You're right about the forms," he said. "I believe you about the forms. I've never covered a refugee camp, and I don't pretend to know what those look like from the inside. But I want to say something about fire."

"Say it."

"Fire is alive. I don't mean metaphorically. I mean it consumes, it breathes, it moves toward what feeds it. When you burn a book, the fire doesn't know it's destroying Whitman or Shakespeare or a girl's copy of — whatever book she loves most. The fire doesn't care. But the fire is beautiful. That's the problem. That's always been the problem. Fire is the most beautiful way to destroy something, and the fact that it's beautiful makes it possible for people to watch and feel warmth rather than grief."

He was leaning forward now, his hands flat on the metal desk, and his voice had shifted into a register I recognized — not from conversation but from prose. The voice of a man who has been thinking about fire for the better part of a century.

"I need the girl to see the fire and feel comfort," he said. "I need her to stand at the door of the heating station and watch the books burn and experience a moment of genuine physical warmth — the glow on her face, the heat against her body — and I need that moment to be *real*. Not ironic. Not a setup for the revelation that comes later. The warmth she feels is the warmth of the burning. Those are not two different things. The fire that destroys the record of the world also keeps her alive through the night. That's not a paradox. That's Tuesday."

"You want the reader to feel the warmth too," I said.

"I want the reader to understand why people let it happen. Not because they're evil. Not because they're stupid. Because they were cold. And someone offered them heat. And the price of the heat was a box of books they hadn't read in years and some government reports they didn't know existed. That's not a difficult bargain. That's the easiest bargain in the world."

El Akkad was watching Bradbury the way I imagine he watches interview subjects — recording not just the words but the angle of delivery, the thing the words are protecting. After a moment he said: "That's the trap of the story. You've just described it. The narrative can't judge the people who let the burning happen, because the narrative understands them. And it can't forgive the burning, because the burning is destroying the proof that someone chose this. Both things have to be true at the same time."

"Yes."

"Then the documentary material needs to carry the judgment. Not the prose. The memos, the testimony, the congressional record — those are the pieces that say what the prose refuses to say. The prose stays with the girl. The prose stays warm. And the documents are cold."

I said I wanted to talk about the mother. Sandra. A librarian. It seemed right that the girl's mother would be a librarian — someone whose entire professional identity is organized around the preservation and accessibility of knowledge, now living in a camp where that knowledge is reclassified as fuel.

"The librarian doesn't protest," El Akkad said. "That's critical. She hands over twenty-two of the thirty-one books. She keeps nine. She hides them inside a quilt. She doesn't make a speech. She doesn't refuse. She performs a precise, private act of preservation that is also an act of disobedience, and she does it with the same administrative competence she used to catalog intake supplies. The resistance and the compliance look identical."

Bradbury shook his head slowly. "No. They look identical from the outside. From inside the woman, they are as different as burning and breathing."

"I know that."

"I want to make sure the prose knows it. Because Omar — and I say this with respect — your instinct is to let the surface carry the whole weight. The flat affect. The weather-report delivery. And you're right that this is powerful. It is. But there are moments when the prose has to do what the character cannot do, which is to grieve. When the mother hands over the books, when the collection team stacks them on a cart next to someone's Bible and a binder of family recipes — the prose needs to pause there. Not to editorialize. To *look*. To let the image sit in the reader's chest long enough to become a bruise."

"That's sentiment."

"That's memory. A Bible and a recipe binder and a girl's copy of a paperback with a cracked spine — those aren't abstractions. Those are the weight and texture of lives that were being lived until someone signed a protocol. If the prose skates past them in the interest of restraint, we lose the thing that makes fiction different from reportage. We lose the smell of the pages burning."

I watched them. This was the argument I'd been hoping for — the real argument, the one that lived in the gap between their two ways of seeing. El Akkad wanted the surface to be enough, because the surface is what he trusts. The observable fact, the documented procedure, the form with the check box. Bradbury wanted the prose to rupture, briefly, into elegy — to let the reader feel what the characters have trained themselves not to feel. Neither of them was wrong. Both of them were asking for something the story couldn't fully deliver at the same time.

"What about nostalgia?" I asked. "The girl's memories of Tucson. The sprinklers. The elm tree. The sound of water being spent on grass."

"Dangerous," El Akkad said.

"Essential," Bradbury said.

They looked at each other.

"Nostalgia is the most manipulative emotion in fiction," El Akkad said. "You invoke a lost world — the smell of cut grass, the sound of rain — and the reader opens up like a wound, and you haven't earned it. You've just played a chord."

"Have you ever lost a world?" Bradbury asked. It wasn't hostile. It was genuinely curious, in the way that genuine curiosity between writers can feel like the blade of a very clean knife.

"I've covered people who have."

"Then you know that the chord isn't manipulation. It's recognition. When a person who has lost their home remembers the specific sound of the sprinkler in the yard, that memory is not sentimental. It is the sharpest, most precise thing they possess. It is more factual than any document. More documented than any report. The body remembers what the policy papers forgot."

El Akkad was quiet for a while. When he spoke, he sounded like someone making a concession he'd known was coming and had been hoping to defer. "Fine. But the nostalgia can't be the camera's default setting. It comes in flashes. Brief. The girl standing at the furnace door and suddenly she's five years old watching sprinklers, and then she's back. The memory hits like a flashbulb, and then it's gone, and the fluorescent light of the camp is the only light there is."

"A flashbulb," Bradbury said, tasting the word. "Not bad. Not bad at all."

I brought up the ending. I said I wasn't sure how to land it. The archive gets found, gets burned. Willa loses everything she's collected. And then what? She starts writing it down from memory — the dates, the numbers, the red-pen annotation. It felt right, but I worried it was too hopeful. Too redemptive. The girl as secret librarian, preserving the truth against the machine.

"It's not hopeful," El Akkad said. "An eleven-year-old writing government data from memory on the backs of ration cards is not hope. It's desperation that has taken the shape of hope because there is no other shape available."

"But does the reader know that?" I asked.

"The reader should feel both things. The act is real. The girl is writing. The preservation is happening. And it is also completely insufficient. She is one child with one memory in a system that has furnaces. The congressional record at the end — the addendum that confirms her testimony was entered as evidence — that doesn't resolve the story. It just proves that the burning happened and was documented and was found to be exactly what she said it was. The system acknowledged her. And then what? The committee issued a report. Reports are paper. Paper burns."

Bradbury rubbed his eyes. He looked tired, suddenly — or not tired, exactly, but like something had settled on him. "The last line," he said. "The last line should be warm. Not warm like hope. Warm like fire. The word 'warm' doing two things at once and neither of them fully cancelling the other."

"That's a lot to put on one word."

"One word is all you need, if it's the right word in the right place. The girl writes by lantern light. The heating station burns outside. The words she puts down are warm. And the reader sits with that — warm because the act of writing is an act of life, warm because fire is what destroyed the thing she's trying to save, warm because in this world heat is what everyone is dying for and killing for. The word holds all of it. You don't need to choose."

"I'm not sure I agree," El Akkad said. "I think the word does too much work. I think the ending should be colder."

"Of course you do."

"I think the last thing the reader should see is the congressional addendum. The clinical language. The exhibit number. The fact that her testimony was 'substantially accurate.' That word — substantially. Not 'accurate.' Not 'verified.' Substantially accurate. Meaning some of it wasn't. Meaning even the act of remembering distorted the record, the way all remembering distorts, and the only thing we're left with is a fourteen-year-old's handwritten reconstruction of data that a government destroyed, and a committee that found the reconstruction good enough but not perfect. That's the ending. Good enough but not perfect. Like everything."

"That's a reporter's ending," Bradbury said.

"Yes."

"It's not a writer's ending."

"I'm not sure those are different things."

They sat with that for a moment. The haze outside the windows had thickened; the sun was a copper disk, the color of a penny held up to a light bulb. Somewhere to the north, the fires were eating through pine forests that had been dying of thirst for a decade.

I said I thought the story needed both endings. The warm word and the cold document. The girl writing by lantern light, and then the congressional language that strips the warmth out and replaces it with exhibit numbers. The reader gets the feeling, and then the feeling gets filed.

Neither of them said anything.

Bradbury reached into the paper bag and took out the last bear claw. He broke it in half and gave one half to El Akkad, who accepted it without comment. They chewed in silence. The haze outside shifted, and for a moment the whole room turned golden, the way rooms do when the light is filtered through smoke — a warmth that comes from something burning.

"The thing I keep thinking about," El Akkad said finally, "is the intake form. The line that says *Notes: Evacuee arrived with personal effects including approx. 30 lbs. of books. Nonessential materials — flag for Thermal Reclamation if Protocol 9 activated.* Twenty-six words. Written by someone who probably had forty more forms to process that afternoon. Someone who was also cold. Someone who was also following a protocol."

"You feel sorry for the form-filler," Bradbury said.

"I understand the form-filler. There's a difference."

"Is there?"

El Akkad looked at him. "Do you really want to have that argument?"

Bradbury smiled. It was not a warm smile. "No. I want to write the story. I want to write it and I want the pages to smell like smoke when the reader is done."

The haze held. The fluorescent buzzed. I closed my notebook, which was full of things I wouldn't need — because the story had already started growing in the space between what these two men agreed on and what they refused to settle.
