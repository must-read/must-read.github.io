The house was Clarke's idea, or rather Clarke's condition — he would only meet if the setting was warm enough to justify bare feet. So we are on a veranda overlooking the Indian Ocean, or something sufficiently like the Indian Ocean that the salt smell is convincing, the heat presses against the backs of our necks, and the light off the water has that particular quality of equatorial noon that makes everything seem slightly overexposed. There are three wicker chairs, a low table with a teapot and two bottles of arrack that nobody has opened, and a ceiling fan turning slowly enough to be decorative.

Clarke is already seated when I arrive, his legs crossed at the ankle, wearing a short-sleeved shirt printed with coral reef fish that might be ironic or might be entirely sincere. He looks the way he looks in the photographs from the Colombo years — lean, sun-darkened, patient in the manner of someone who has been waiting for the universe to do something interesting and is not yet disappointed.

Chambers arrives twelve minutes late, carrying a canvas bag stuffed with what appears to be knitting. She drops into the chair beside me with an apologetic grimace and immediately starts pulling yarn from the bag — a thick, rust-colored wool that seems wildly inappropriate for the climate.

"Sorry. I got lost in the garden."

"There isn't a garden," I say.

"There's always a garden," she says, and begins casting on stitches with a speed that suggests this is not optional behavior but a necessary component of thought.

I want to talk about the alien artifact. I have pages of notes about Rama — the mathematics of its rotation, the Cylindrical Sea, the biots, the terrible indifferent majesty of a thing that passed through our solar system without caring that we existed. I want to start there because it seems like the obvious starting point for a story about first contact. Clarke, I expect, will have opinions about the science. The hard numbers. The orbital mechanics.

"Before all that," Clarke says, as if he has read my notes through the back of the paper, "tell me about the ship."

"The ship?"

"The human vessel. The one that encounters whatever we decide to build. What sort of ship is it?"

I hadn't thought about the ship. I had been thinking about the Object. "A research vessel? Something equipped for —"

"No." This from Chambers, who does not look up from her knitting. "Not a research vessel. A supply ship. Something unglamorous."

Clarke tilts his head. The ceiling fan turns. I can hear the ocean doing whatever it does when no one is watching it — existing, I suppose, at considerable volume.

"Why unglamorous?" I ask.

"Because the encounter is better if it's accidental. If nobody aboard is prepared for it. If they're there to fix a sensor array or deliver cargo, and they happen to be the closest crewed vessel when the thing opens up." She counts stitches under her breath, loses her place, counts again. "The tension between the extraordinary event and the ordinary people — that's where the story lives. Not in the science team with their protocols and their first-contact contingencies. In the maintenance technician who was in the middle of fixing a water recycler."

I write this down. Clarke is watching Chambers with an expression I cannot quite read — not disagreement, exactly, but the careful attention of a man evaluating a structural argument.

"Commander Norton was not a scientist," he says. "He was a naval officer. A practical man in command of a survey vessel. I take your point about ordinariness."

"I'm not making a point about ordinariness," Chambers says. "I'm making a point about intimacy. A small crew on a battered ship — four people, five, six — who eat together, who argue about the hydroponics, who have running jokes about whose turn it is to clean the air filters. The domesticity has to be real. Not sketched. Not implied. The reader needs to smell the galley."

"The reader needs to smell the galley," Clarke repeats, and I cannot tell if he is mocking her or memorizing the phrase.

"Yes. Because when you walk those people into the interior of an alien structure two kilometers long, the contrast does the work. You don't have to tell the reader this is vast and incomprehensible. You just cut from a conversation about basil to a lidar reading that says the interior is bigger than the exterior. The domesticity is the lens. Without it, the cosmic stuff is just spectacle."

Clarke uncrosses his ankles and recrosses them the other way. "The cosmic stuff," he says, "is not spectacle. It is the entire point. The encounter with the genuinely alien — not the alien-as-human-metaphor, not the alien-as-political-commentary, but the alien as something so far beyond our categories that the act of perceiving it changes the shape of what we know. That is what science fiction exists to do. Everything else is furniture."

"The furniture is where people live," Chambers says quietly.

There is a silence. The fan turns. I realize I am holding my pen above the paper without writing anything, which is a posture I adopt when two people I respect are saying things I agree with simultaneously and in opposition.

"Can I suggest," I say carefully, "that the story needs both? The domestic texture of the crew, their relationships — but also the hard rendering of the alien as genuinely alien? Instruments giving contradictory readings. Geometries that don't resolve. The alien interior described with enough scientific specificity that the reader trusts the strangeness."

Clarke looks at me. Chambers looks at me. I have the sensation of having said something so obvious it barely qualifies as a contribution.

"Yes," Clarke says. "Obviously. The question is proportion."

"And whose eyes we see it through," Chambers adds. "That's the real argument. Not whether the cosmic and the domestic coexist — of course they do, they have to. The argument is whether the viewpoint character is oriented toward the stars or toward the people beside her."

"Why not both?" I say, and immediately regret it, because 'why not both' is the kind of thing a person says when they want to avoid the actual question.

"Because a character oriented in two directions at once is oriented in no direction," Clarke says. "She has to want something. What does she want?"

I think about this. The protagonist — I am already thinking of her as the maintenance technician, the person Chambers proposed — needs a flaw, a specific absence. Not a generic backstory wound. Something that shapes the way she moves through the world.

"She's been running," I say.

Chambers puts down her knitting. This is, I will learn, the highest form of attention she gives.

"From what?"

"From grief. Someone died — her mother, maybe — and instead of going home, she logged in to the next deployment. And the one after that. She's been fixing things for nine years because fixing things is what she knows how to do, and if she stops fixing things, she'll have to sit with the fact that she didn't go home."

The ocean does its thing. Clarke is looking out at the water. Chambers picks up the knitting again, but slowly, as if she is knitting the idea into the pattern.

"That's a Chambers character," Clarke says, not unkindly.

"It is," Chambers agrees. "But the question is what happens when that character enters your artifact. Because inside Rama, the human emotional state was largely irrelevant. The Object didn't care about Norton's feelings. It operated on its own terms. The humans were observers. That's what made it frightening and beautiful — the absolute indifference of the thing."

"You want indifference," I say.

"I want something that does not perform for the human gaze," Clarke says. "The worst thing you can do with an alien artifact is have it respond to the protagonist's emotional state. If the maintenance technician walks in carrying grief, and the Object shows her a vision of her mother — that is not first contact. That is therapy with set dressing."

I write this down in capital letters and underline it twice.

"Agreed," Chambers says, and I look up because I expected her to push back. "The Object should be indifferent. But indifference is not the same as emptiness. The thing can be full — full of light, full of structure, full of patterns the instruments cannot decode — without any of it being for the humans. They are inside something that is doing its own work, and they happen to be present. Like walking through a forest that doesn't know you're there."

"A forest knows you're there," Clarke says. "Ecosystems respond to intrusion."

"Fine. Like walking through a cathedral that doesn't know you're there."

"Cathedrals were built for the people inside them."

Chambers makes a sound that might be a laugh or might be a stitch going wrong. "You are impossible. Like walking through a geological formation, then. A cave system. The stalactites are beautiful but they did not grow for your benefit."

"Better," Clarke concedes. "Though I would note that the beauty of a stalactite is a human projection. The calcium carbonate deposit is not beautiful. It simply is."

"That's the entire argument, isn't it?" I say, and both of them look at me. "Whether the wonder the protagonist feels inside the Object is a property of the Object or a property of the protagonist. Clarke, you want the Object to simply be — vast, alien, indifferent, operating on principles we cannot parse. Chambers, you want the protagonist's emotional life to be the real subject, even inside the alien space. The story has to hold both without collapsing one into the other."

"Don't collapse them," Clarke says. "Let them exist in parallel. The Object does not care about the maintenance technician's dead mother. The maintenance technician does not understand the Object's purpose. They are in the same space, unable to communicate, and that inability is the point."

"But she says something inside it," Chambers says. "She has to. Not to the Object — she's not that foolish. To the person beside her. Someone younger, someone scared. She tells a story about her mother. Not because the Object prompts it, but because sitting in the presence of something that vast and that indifferent does something to your sense of proportion. The thing you've been carrying — the water recycler you've been hiding behind — it becomes very small. And when it becomes small enough, you can finally look at it."

Clarke is quiet for a long moment. Then: "That's not terrible."

"High praise."

"The condition is that the Object must not acknowledge the confession. No pulsing in response. No convenient shift in the light. The protagonist speaks her grief into a space that does not hear it, and the lack of response is itself the thing that frees her. Because she's been waiting — nine years of waiting — for something to tell her it's all right. The Object will not tell her it's all right. It will not tell her anything. And that is the permission she's been waiting for."

I put down my pen because my hand is shaking slightly. That is the story. Or the seed of it, at least — the emotional architecture that everything else hangs on.

"The science has to be rigorous," Clarke adds, as if he has not just said something that rearranged the inside of my chest. "The instruments, the readings, the dimensions. I want specific numbers. The aperture diameter. The lidar distances. The atmospheric composition. The reader should be able to check the physics and find it plausible, even where it is impossible. Especially where it is impossible. The precision is what makes the impossibility real."

"Nine point four meters," I say, pulling a number from nowhere.

"Why nine point four?"

"Because it's specific enough to be believable and arbitrary enough to be alien. A round number would suggest human design. An irrational number would suggest mathematics. Nine point four suggests measurement — someone or something decided on that width, but for reasons we cannot reconstruct."

Clarke smiles. It is a small, sharp smile. "You're learning."

Chambers has finished whatever she was knitting — a small square, rust-colored, that she folds and tucks into her bag. "I want to talk about what happens after."

"After?"

"After they leave the Object. After they dock with the ship and the diagnostics come back clean and everyone sits down to dinner. I want the scene where the protagonist is alone at the communications terminal, trying to write a message to her sister. I want her to type four words and not send them."

"What four words?" I ask.

"I don't know yet. Something small. Something that wouldn't mean anything to anyone else." She pulls out a new color of yarn — deep blue, almost indigo. "The Object should leave. A few weeks later, no warning, no acceleration the instruments can detect. Gone. And the story should end not with the departure but with the protagonist and the unsent message. The cosmic event is over. The human event is just beginning."

"Or not beginning," Clarke says. "She might never send it."

"She might never send it," Chambers agrees. "That's fine. The story doesn't have to resolve her grief. It just has to make her look at it."

"And the Object?" I ask. "Does it mean something? In the larger sense — is there a purpose behind its visit?"

Clarke's eyes go to the horizon, where the Indian Ocean meets the sky in a line so sharp it looks ruled. "There should be a detail. A buried detail, something in the sensor data that only becomes apparent later, after analysis. A pattern in the energy emissions that suggests the Object is part of something larger — a curve, an arc, a trajectory that implies a destination two hundred years in the future. Not explained. Not explained ever. Just present in the data, like a question no one alive will see answered."

"That's cruel," Chambers says.

"That's honest," Clarke replies. "The universe is not obligated to operate on human timescales. If the pattern completes in two centuries, then for the characters in this story, the encounter is a fragment. A single data point on a curve they cannot see the shape of. And that is exactly how contact with a genuinely alien intelligence would feel. Not a revelation. A glimpse."

"A glimpse of what?"

"Of the fact that something is happening, and it is not about us."

The fan turns. The yarn moves through Chambers' fingers — indigo now, a color like deep space if deep space were soft. I think about the maintenance technician in her bunk on the supply ship, the unsent message on her screen, the four words sitting in a draft folder. Outside her viewport, the Object hangs in its orbit, carrying its two-hundred-year pattern in silence. It does not know about the message. It does not know about the mother's garden on Titan or the frangipani or the nine years of running. It does not know about any of it, and that is not a tragedy but a fact — the largest fact there is, the one that contains all the others without explaining any of them.

"I think the protagonist should be called Naveli," Chambers says.

"Why Naveli?"

"Because it means new, in a language I'm not going to specify, and because it doesn't sound like a protagonist's name. It sounds like a person's name."

Clarke nods. "Naveli. Fine. Let the writer sort out the rest." He looks at me. "You'll need to get the lidar right."

"I know."

"And the atmospheric readings inside the Object. Nitrogen-oxygen at standard pressure — that's deliberate on the Object's part, or it isn't. Don't decide which. Let the ambiguity sit."

"I know."

Chambers stands up, tucking the indigo yarn into her bag alongside the rust-colored square. "One more thing. The crew. Give them a cook who does science on the side. Give them a captain who speaks in edited sentences. Give them a young woman who presses her forehead against viewports. Make them argue about lemons."

"Lemons?"

"There should be a lemon. Just one. It becomes important in a way that only makes sense if you've ever been on a ship where fresh citrus is a political event."

She slings the bag over her shoulder and walks toward the garden that does not exist. Clarke watches her go, then turns back to the ocean.

"She's right about the lemon," he says. "Don't tell her I said that."

I sit on the veranda for another hour after they leave, watching the fan turn, listening to the ocean, trying to hold all of it — the Object and the lemon and the frangipani and the two-hundred-year curve and the four unsent words and the nine-point-four-meter aperture — in my head at once. I can't. It won't fit. That, I suspect, is the point.
