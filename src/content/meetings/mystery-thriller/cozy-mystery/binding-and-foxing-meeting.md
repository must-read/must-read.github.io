The pub was Christie's idea. She insisted on it — not a hotel lounge, not a café with ambient music, not the kind of place where people bring laptops. A proper pub, she said, with a fire and carpeting that has absorbed forty years of spilled lager and opinions. The kind of establishment where no one is performing relaxation. We ended up in a place off the Headrow in Leeds, because Christie wanted to be near the Dales without being in them, and French had a reading in Manchester the following day and would not go further north than she had to. The fire was gas but convincing. The carpeting met Christie's specifications exactly.

I arrived first and ordered a pint I did not want because I was nervous and needed something to hold. Christie came in ten minutes later, smaller than I expected — I always expect her to be taller, though I have met her before — wearing a wool coat the color of strong tea and carrying a handbag that looked like it contained everything she might need for any emergency up to and including a second war. She ordered a gin and tonic, inspected the glass, and said, "The ice is wrong but it will do."

French arrived last, apologetic about the train, her jacket still damp from rain. She ordered whiskey neat and sat down and immediately started pulling apart a beer mat, the way people do when they are already thinking about something and their hands need occupation.

"I want to write about a locked room," I said, because I had been rehearsing this opening on the train and wanted to get it out before it curdled. "Someone dies in a locked library during a snowstorm. A retired bookseller investigates."

Christie put her gin down. "Good. Go on."

"The bookseller is our detective. She's come back to her dead aunt's house in the Yorkshire Dales to settle the estate. She hasn't been there in forty-five years. There are guests trapped by the storm. She interviews them one by one. Classic closed-circle."

"You've described the furniture," French said. She was not being unkind. She was being precise. "A locked room, a snowstorm, a bookseller. What is the room locking in?"

"The mystery. The death."

"No. What is the room locking in for *her*? The bookseller? Why does she care? Not professionally — she's not police. Why does she start interviewing people instead of sitting down and waiting for morning?"

I hesitated. Christie watched me hesitate with the expression of someone who already knows the answer and is curious whether I'll find it.

"Because she recognizes the dead woman," I tried.

"Recognizing a corpse is a reason to call the police," French said. "It's not a reason to become one."

"Fine. Because the death connects to something in her own past. Something she's been avoiding."

French nodded and stopped dismantling the beer mat. "Now we have a character."

Christie made a small sound that was not quite agreement. "We have the beginning of a character. We do not yet have a detective. A detective is someone who wants the answer more than they want their comfort. Your bookseller — does she want the answer?"

"I think she's afraid of it."

"Then she is not a detective. She is a suspect."

I must have looked confused, because Christie softened — just slightly, the way a well-made hinge gives when oiled. "Everyone in a proper mystery is a suspect, including the person asking the questions. The interesting ones are the people who suspect themselves. Your bookseller — she has been away from this house for forty-five years. Why? People do not stay away from places they loved unless they are staying away from something they saw there."

French leaned forward. "That's the story. Not the locked room. The locked *memory*. She's come back to this house where something happened to her decades ago, and the death in the library is the key that turns in that older lock." She paused. "I keep writing about this. Detectives who investigate a crime and end up investigating themselves. The case that opens a wound you thought was a scar."

"You do keep writing about it," Christie said. "I have sometimes wondered whether it is a theme or a compulsion."

French looked at her. The fire popped. Someone at the bar laughed. I held my pint and tried to be invisible.

"It's the truest thing about investigation," French said, finally. "You cannot look at anything long enough without starting to see yourself in it. Especially the ugly parts. Especially the parts you've been trained to catalogue and file as somebody else's problem."

"I disagree," Christie said, pleasantly. "A good investigator files the ugly parts correctly because they are *evidence*. Emotional contamination is precisely what muddies a case. Your detective weeping over the body is not insight. It is mess."

"And your detective pointing at the murderer like a magician revealing a trick is not insight either. It is performance."

"It is *satisfaction*. The reader deserves satisfaction."

"The reader deserves truth."

"The reader can have both."

They looked at each other across the table, and I understood that this was not a disagreement they were having for the first time. This was a disagreement that lived between them like a shared piece of furniture — well-worn, sat upon from different angles, never quite comfortable for either.

I said, carefully, "What if she's both? A detective and a suspect. What if the locked room is her own investigation? She's systematic — she interviews each guest, she notices the physical clues, she follows the evidence. But the evidence keeps pointing back toward her. Not because she killed anyone, but because her silence — her forty-five years of not coming back, not asking what happened — is part of the crime."

Christie sipped her gin. "Complicity through omission. Yes. That is more interesting than guilt."

"It's practically the same thing," French said.

"It is not at all the same thing and you know it. Guilt requires agency. Complicity requires only presence and the decision to look away. Your bookseller looked away. She was — what? A girl when it happened?"

"Seventeen," I said.

"Seventeen. She saw something she did not understand and she filed it — the way she would later file books, by category, by condition, by the system that keeps everything in its place. She built her whole life as a filing system. Edinburgh. A shop. Ordered shelves. Everything catalogued, everything in acid-free tissue paper, everything handled with gloves."

I stared at her. "How did you know about Edinburgh?"

"I didn't. But it is obvious. A woman running from something would not go to London — too many people, too many accidental encounters. She would go somewhere grey and contained and bookish, where she could be perfectly alone in public, where no one would ask why a woman in her twenties had chosen to spend her life pricing other people's libraries instead of building anything of her own."

French was smiling. Not happily — it was the smile of someone watching a collaborator do something she admires and resents in equal measure. "You just built a psychology from a profession. I spend three chapters doing what you did in four sentences."

"That is because you are building a house and I am building a clock. Different projects. Different tools."

"And which is the bookseller? A house or a clock?"

Christie considered this. "She is a clock. She runs precisely. She is never late. She notices everything and understands nothing about herself. When the mechanism finally jams, she does not know why, because she has never looked inside her own casing."

"No," French said. "She's a house. She has rooms she hasn't entered in decades. The house remembers things she won't let herself remember. When she walks back into Crossbell — that's good, by the way, Crossbell, it sounds like a place where things happened — when she walks back in, the house *tells* her body what her mind has refused to keep. The smell of lavender and woodsmoke. The floorboards under the carpet. The proportions that have shrunk because she was a child when she last measured them."

I was writing in my notebook, fast, trying to get both of them down before the ideas settled into paraphrase. "The smell is important," I said. "She walks in and the smell hits her and for a moment she's seventeen and then she's sixty-two and the gap between those two things is the whole story."

"Yes," French said.

"No," Christie said. "The gap is the *backstory*. The story is the locked room and the dead woman and the storm outside. You must not confuse atmosphere with architecture."

"Atmosphere *is* architecture," French said. "The way a room smells shapes the conversation that happens in it. The way a memory surfaces — not as narrative but as sensation, as a flash of cold grass under bare feet — that is not decoration. It is the structure of consciousness."

Christie finished her gin. She set the glass down with the careful precision of someone who believes surfaces matter. "I will concede one point. Sensation is more honest than narration. A woman saying 'I was frightened' is less convincing than a woman feeling the cold stone of a wall against her palm and not knowing why her hand is shaking. But you must give me the architecture. You must give me the interviews — each guest in turn, each conversation peeling back a layer, each revelation reframing the previous one. That is not a trick. That is how the reader learns what the detective learns, at the rate the detective learns it."

"Agreed," French said, and it came out like a concession — not reluctant, exactly, but costly. "The interviews are the engine. But the fuel is her. What she remembers between interviews. What the house gives back to her when she's alone."

"The pantry passage," I said. They both looked at me. "A secret passage. From the kitchen to the library. She found it as a child. It's how she discovers the body — she goes through the hidden way, not the door. Because the door is bolted from inside."

Christie's eyes went sharp. The transformation was immediate and a little unsettling — one moment a small woman in a good coat, the next a mechanism for plot, whirring. "The bolt. Yes. The door is bolted from inside, so anyone entering through the passage would appear to have found the room sealed. But the passage itself is the answer. Whoever killed the woman — if she was killed — also knew about the passage."

"Who else knows about it?" French asked.

"The housekeeper," I said. "She's been cleaning around this house's secrets for twenty years."

"The housekeeper always knows," Christie said, with something close to satisfaction. "She knows the passage, she knows the journals, she knows the family history. She is the one who has been living inside the locked room all along while everyone else merely visits."

French picked up her whiskey and held it without drinking. "But the bookseller found the passage first. As a child. Which means the passage is also *her* secret. The house gave it to her. And now the same passage leads her to a dead woman. There's something in that — the house teaching her how to find things she shouldn't, and her spending the rest of her life wishing it hadn't."

I said, "What if she never tells the reader what the final secret is?"

They both went quiet. The pub noise filled the space where their voices had been — glasses clinking, the football on the television in the corner, a group of students arguing about something that sounded like philosophy but was probably a TV show.

"Explain," Christie said.

"The bookseller finds the page from the journal. She reads it. She knows what happened to the girl who disappeared forty-five years ago. But she doesn't tell us. She just — sets it down. Leaves it visible. And we never know."

Christie's face did something complicated. "That is either very brave or very lazy and I cannot tell which."

"It's honest," French said, quietly. "Some things belong to the dead. The information on that page — it's not ours. It's not the reader's. It belongs to the girl who vanished and the mother who died reaching for it. To reveal it would be — I don't know. Violation."

"The reader will feel cheated."

"Some will. The right ones won't."

"I am not in the business of writing for the right readers, Tana. I write for all of them. Every single person who picks up one of my books deserves to reach the last page and feel that the contract has been honored. A mystery promises an answer."

"A mystery promises a *question worth asking*. The answer is optional."

Christie opened her mouth, closed it, and then said something I did not expect: "My best book — I will not say which — the answer is a cheat. Everyone knows it. The answer works mechanically and fails emotionally because no real human being would do what the killer does in that book. The machinery is perfect and the soul of it is hollow. I have lived with that for a long time."

French reached across the table and touched Christie's hand, briefly, the way you touch someone who has said something that cost them. Christie withdrew her hand — not rudely, but firmly, the way you close a book you have shown someone a page of.

"The bookseller catalogues instead of feeling," I said, because the silence was becoming something I did not know how to sit inside. "She prices first editions instead of grieving. She notices bindings before she notices faces. That is her flaw and her gift and they are the same thing."

"Binding and foxing," Christie said.

"What?"

"The title. *Binding and Foxing*. Foxing is the brown spotting that appears on old paper — from age, from moisture, from iron in the pulp reacting with time. You cannot remove it without damaging the page. You can only note it in your condition report and move on." She paused. "Rather like memory."

French said, "That's good. That's annoyingly good."

"Thank you. I have been doing this for some time."

I wrote it down. *Binding and Foxing*. The binding that holds a book together and the damage that cannot be undone without destroying the thing itself. The bookseller's whole life in two technical terms — one about structure, one about decay.

"She should be imperfect," French said, turning her glass in her hands. "Not charmingly imperfect. Actually imperfect. She missed her mother's funeral because she was cataloguing books. That's not a quirk. That's a sickness. She has replaced every human connection with professional competence, and she has been so good at it that nobody, including herself, has noticed that the replacement is not an equivalent."

"Agreed," I said. "She is not likeable in the cozy sense. She is precise and cold and occasionally funny in the way that very controlled people are funny — dry, observational, turned inward."

"She must still be someone the reader wants to spend time with," Christie said. "You can be cold and compelling. You cannot be cold and dull. Give her — I don't know. A way of seeing the world that makes the reader see it differently. The way she reads rooms, reads objects, reads the conditions of things. If she picks up a book, the reader should learn something about that book they did not know. If she looks at a woman's shoes, the reader should understand something about the woman."

"Her professional eye is her detective method," I said. "She reads people the way she reads books — by condition, by provenance, by the damage they're trying to hide."

"But she cannot read herself," French said. "That's the locked room that matters."

The fire hissed. Christie flagged the bartender for another gin. French had stopped shredding the beer mat and was folding the pieces into a small, precise stack, the way you tidy a workspace when you're done with a problem.

"One thing," French said. "The village. Everyone in it knows. Mrs. Dillard knows. The solicitor probably knows, or knows enough to profit from not knowing. The walking couple — one of them grew up there. The journalist is sniffing around. Every person in this house is carrying a piece of the secret, and none of them have put their pieces together because putting them together would mean admitting what the village did. Which was nothing. Which was the crime."

"Collective silence," Christie said. "Yes. Orient Express, inverted. Instead of everyone being guilty of *action*, everyone is guilty of *inaction*. They all knew something, or could have known, and they chose not to. Your bookseller included."

"Especially her," French said.

"Especially her," Christie agreed, and that agreement — reluctant, arrived at from opposite directions — settled over the table like a draft from a window neither of them had noticed was open.

I looked at my notebook. It was full. The margins were full. I had written over my own writing in places, palimpsest, one idea layered on another until the page was nearly illegible.

"I think I have what I need," I said.

"You have more than you need," Christie said. "The art is in what you leave out. Remember that the reader does not need to know everything. The reader needs to believe that *you* know everything, and have chosen."

French said nothing to that. She was looking at the fire, her whiskey finished, the small stack of beer mat fragments squared and centered on the table in front of her like a cairn marking a place someone had been.
