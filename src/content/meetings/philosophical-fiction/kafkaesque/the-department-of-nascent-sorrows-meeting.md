The office had no business being on the third floor. There was a second-floor office available — I had confirmed this with the building manager — but when I arrived, the elevator was out of service and a handwritten sign directed me upstairs. The sign's lettering was careful, almost beautiful, the kind of penmanship that suggests someone has been writing the same instruction for years. I climbed. By the time I reached the landing, I was slightly out of breath, which felt appropriate, because the two people already seated at the table looked like they had been waiting not just for me but for someone to arrive winded, slightly discomposed, already at a disadvantage.

Kafka sat with his hands folded on the table, his posture so correct it seemed like a form of argument. He had a glass of water he never touched. Lispector was smoking — or had been smoking — the cigarette was mostly ash, balanced on the edge of a saucer she'd appropriated from somewhere. She watched me sit down with an expression I could not read, which I would later understand was her default.

"I want to write about a government office," I said, because I had decided on the way up that I would be direct, that directness might be a kind of armor. "A woman receives a letter summoning her to classify an emotion. But the emotion — or the experience, whatever it is — can't survive being described. The form she has to fill out destroys the thing it's meant to capture."

Kafka nodded once, slowly, as if I had confirmed something he already suspected. "The form is not the problem," he said.

"No?"

"The form is the solution. That is the problem. The state has already determined that this experience must be processed. The woman's inability to describe it is irrelevant to the machinery. The machinery will process her whether she completes the form or not. The question is not whether she can describe the experience. The question is what happens to her when she tries."

Lispector tapped the ash from her cigarette, though there was nothing left to tap. "You are both wrong," she said. "The question is what the experience is. Not what happens around it. Not what the state does with it. What it is. You want to write about a woman in a government office — fine, we can furnish the office, we can number the windows, we can make the queue move at exactly the right pace. But none of that matters if the thing at the center is hollow. If the experience she cannot describe is just a placeholder for 'the ineffable' — some vague gesture at what language can't reach — then you have an allegory, not a story. Allegories are for people who are afraid of what they actually want to say."

I opened my mouth and closed it. She was right, or at least she was right enough that I needed to sit with it before I could determine where she was wrong.

"The experience needs to be specific," I said.

"It needs to be physical," she said. "It needs to happen in the body. Not in the mind. The mind is where you go to avoid things. The body is where things happen to you whether you want them to or not. Your woman — does she have a body?"

"She sorts mail."

"That's an occupation, not a body."

Kafka cleared his throat. It was a small, precise sound, like a clerk stamping a document. "The body is important," he said, and I could hear the concession in it, the slight strain of agreeing with someone whose methods he did not entirely trust. "But the office is also a body. The institution has its own physicality — the smell of floor wax, the creak of the man's shoes in the queue, the window that has been painted over. These are not decorations. They are the way the state makes itself felt. The state does not argue with you. It surrounds you. It becomes the air."

"The air is not consciousness," Lispector said. "The air is atmosphere. I am talking about something else. I am talking about the moment when a person encounters the raw fact of their own existence — before language, before category, before the self has organized the experience into something livable. You know this moment. Everyone knows it. It lasts half a second. It usually happens in the morning, before you have remembered who you are. And it is — there is no word for what it is. But it is not atmosphere. It is the opposite of atmosphere. Atmosphere is what you build to keep it out."

I wrote this down. I was writing everything down, not because I would use all of it but because the act of writing felt like it was keeping me in the room. Without the pen moving, I might drift — or worse, I might try to synthesize what they were saying into something coherent, and coherence, I was beginning to understand, was precisely the enemy.

"So there are two forces," I said. "The institution, which wants to classify. And the experience, which resists classification. And the woman is caught between them."

"She is not caught," Kafka said. "She is compliant. That is what makes it unbearable. She goes to the office. She waits in the queue. She fills out the form. She does everything correctly. The horror — if horror is the word, and it may not be — is that compliance does not protect her. It never protects anyone. You comply and the machinery processes you and at the end you are processed, which is different from being understood, which is different from being seen, which is different from being helped. The state does not help. The state classifies. And classification is a kind of burial."

"A burial with a receipt," Lispector said, and for a moment I thought she was making a joke, but her face did not change.

"Yes," Kafka said. "Exactly. A burial with a receipt. You leave the office holding a piece of paper that proves you were there, that proves the experience occurred, that proves it has been noted. And the experience itself is gone. Or not gone — underneath. Underneath the receipt."

There was a silence. Outside the window, which was closed, I could hear traffic, faintly, the way you hear the ocean in a building near the coast — not the actual sound but the idea of the sound, the pressure of it against the glass. I looked at my notes. I had written: *The form replaces the experience. The receipt buries it. Compliance is the mechanism.*

"I have a question," I said. "The woman — when she sits down to fill out the form and encounters the blank page — what happens to her? Not philosophically. Physically. In the room."

Lispector leaned forward. This was her territory and she knew it. "The page looks at her," she said. "Not metaphorically. The blank page has a quality — a pressure, a weight. White is not neutral. White demands. And when she looks at the page, she feels the gap open. The gap between herself and her own experience. The gap that is normally papered over — by habit, by language, by the very fact of having a name and an address and a registration number. All of that falls away. Not dramatically. Not like a revelation. Like a floor giving way. Slowly. The boards just — separate. And underneath is not nothing. Underneath is something so raw, so prior to everything she has built on top of it, that she cannot even say whether it is good or bad. It is before good and bad."

"This is the moment of the story," I said. "This is where the two registers — the bureaucratic and the interior — collide."

Kafka shifted in his chair. "They do not collide," he said. "They coexist. That is worse. The fluorescent lights keep buzzing. The clerks keep processing. The queue moves. And she is sitting in a wooden chair having the most shattering experience of her life and nothing around her acknowledges it. The institution cannot acknowledge it. The institution has no category for the floor giving way. It has categories for what you do after the floor gives way — the form, the classification, the code. But not for the giving way itself. The giving way is invisible to the system. It happens in a room that the system designed, under lights that the system installed, but it is not something the system can see."

"That is what makes it Kafkaesque," Lispector said. She said the word as if it were a species of insect she had found on her plate. "The system is not cruel. It is simply not built to perceive what it is doing. The cruelty is structural. Ambient. Like the fluorescent buzzing."

I looked at Kafka. He did not seem offended by having his name used as an adjective, but neither did he seem pleased. He picked up his glass of water, examined it, and put it down without drinking.

"I want to ask about the ending," I said, though I knew this was dangerous. Neither of them believed in endings — not clean ones, not the kind that resolve. "She fills out the form. She writes something approximate. She submits it. What happens?"

"Nothing happens," Kafka said immediately. "She submits the form and the clerk reads it and stamps it and tells her she will receive a letter. The letter will arrive on a Wednesday, because government correspondence arrives on Wednesdays. She leaves. She goes home. She makes tea. She waits."

"That can't be the ending."

"Why not?"

"Because she's had this — this shattering encounter with the substrate of her own existence, and then she just goes home and makes tea?"

Kafka looked at me with something that might have been pity. "What would you have her do? Transform? Refuse? Tear up the form? That is what a story does when it is afraid of its own conclusion. It manufactures a dramatic gesture to avoid sitting with the fact that nothing changes. She goes home. She makes tea. The gap is still there. The form did not fix it. The form was never going to fix it. And tomorrow she will wake up and see her ceiling and for one half-second the gap will be there again, and then it will close, and she will be herself again, and being herself will feel like a kind of clothing she puts on — familiar, slightly uncomfortable, impossible to remove."

Lispector stubbed out a cigarette that had already been stubbed out. "He is right about the tea," she said, and I could hear what it cost her. "But I want to be careful. The ending should not perform its own resignation. If she goes home and makes tea and the prose says, in effect, 'look how nothing changes, look how the system persists, look how we are all processed' — that is an announced theme. That is the story telling you what to feel about the story. The tea should just be tea. The waiting should just be waiting. The reader can do the arithmetic."

"There is something else," Kafka said. "The code. On the stamp. The clerk stamps her form with a code — NCS-0 or something similarly opaque. She does not know what it means. The clerk does not explain it. It could be a classification. It could be the absence of a classification. It could be a placeholder for something that does not yet have a category. And she will never know which, because the system does not explain itself. The system stamps and files and sends letters. What the stamps mean is not her concern. That is what the system would say, if the system spoke: your concern is to comply, not to understand."

"NCS," I said. "Nascent Classification Status? No Category Specified?"

"It does not matter what it stands for," Kafka said. "That is the point. If you explain it, you domesticate it. The code must remain opaque. Opacity is how the system maintains its authority. If you could understand the code, you could dispute it. The system does not permit dispute. It permits appeal, which is different — appeal is a process, and the process takes time, and the time is how the system converts resistance into compliance. You appeal, and the appeal is received, and you wait, and while you wait you are still inside the system, and the waiting is itself a form of processing."

Lispector was watching him. She had a quality of attention that was almost aggressive — not hostile, but unrelenting, as if she were trying to see past what he was saying to what he meant underneath what he was saying. "You are describing a machine," she said. "A very precise, very horrible machine. And you are right that the machine exists and that it does these things. But the woman is not a machine. The woman has — I keep coming back to this and I will keep coming back to it until it is heard — the woman has an interior. An interior that is not a function of the machine. An interior that exists before and after and underneath the machine. And the story cannot only be about the machine. It must also be about the interior. The gap. The half-second of raw perception. The ceiling that is just a ceiling before it becomes her ceiling in her room in her life. That is where the story lives. Not in the queue. In the gap."

"It lives in both," I said, and immediately regretted it, because it sounded like mediation, and mediation was not what either of them wanted. But it was also true. The story needed both registers — the precise, almost clinical rendering of the institution, and the dissolving, recursive interiority of the experience. The institution provided the frame. The interior provided the thing the frame could not contain.

"The danger," Lispector said, "is that the institution becomes scenery. Backdrop. A colorful setting for the real drama, which is interior. That would be my story, not ours. The institution has to be — what is the word? — load-bearing. It has to be doing something to her that she cannot do to herself."

"The institution is giving her the form," Kafka said. "The form is forcing her to attempt what cannot be attempted — to describe in language what exists before language. Without the form, the gap would simply be the gap. Private. Unnamed. But the form makes a demand. The demand is: name this thing. And the naming is what destroys it. So the institution is not the backdrop. The institution is the instrument of destruction. It destroys by requiring articulation. And she complies, because one complies, and the compliance is the tragedy, if tragedy is the word, and it is probably not the word."

I sat back. The room had gotten darker. The window faced west and the light had shifted, the way light shifts in the late afternoon, not dimming exactly but thickening, becoming amber, becoming the color of old paper. I thought about the woman — Sonja, I was going to call her Sonja — sitting in the Department of Nascent Sorrows with the form on her knees, looking at the blank page, feeling the floor give way beneath a structure she had never examined because it had always held.

"One more thing," Lispector said. "The woman in the queue. The one who tells your protagonist to describe the borders of the thing she cannot describe. She is important. She is the person who has already been processed and has survived. She has learned the trick — you describe what surrounds the gap, and the institution infers the gap from its borders, and the inference is filed as fact, and the fact replaces the gap, and life goes on. She is not wise. She is not kind. She is efficient. She has learned to give the machine what it needs so that the machine leaves her alone. Your protagonist should listen to her. And your protagonist should do what she says. And it should work, in the sense that the form gets completed and the stamp gets stamped and the letter will arrive on Wednesday. And it should fail, in the sense that describing the borders of a thing is not the same as knowing the thing, and the woman knows this, and the protagonist knows this, and the reader knows this, and nobody says it."

Kafka nodded. "Nobody says it," he repeated. "That is correct. The story says nothing. The story describes. The descriptions are precise. And the precision is what makes the silence audible."

I looked at my notes. They were a mess. I had written words in margins, drawn arrows between phrases, circled things I did not remember circling. Somewhere in the mess was the story — not its plot, which I could already see, but its texture, the way it would feel on the tongue, the way the sentences would move between the bureaucratic and the interior, between the numbered windows and the gap.

Lispector stood up. She left the dead cigarette on the saucer and picked up a coat that had been draped over the back of her chair. At the door she paused.

"The ceiling," she said. "In the morning. When she wakes up and sees the ceiling before she remembers who she is. Write that moment as if you are describing it for someone who has never had a body. That is the whole story. Everything else — the office, the queue, the form — everything else is what happens after you fail to stay in that moment."

She left. The door did not close all the way. Through the gap I could see the hallway, which was empty, which was just a hallway, which was not a metaphor for anything.

Kafka finished his water. I had not seen him drink it, but the glass was empty. He set it down with a small, precise sound.

"She is right about the ceiling," he said. "But she is wrong about the office being secondary. The office is not what happens after you fail. The office is why you fail. The office exists so that you will fail. That is its function. Not its malfunction. Its function."

He buttoned his coat, which had been buttoned the entire time, and left through the door that Lispector had left open.

I sat in the room alone. The light was amber. The building hummed with something I could not identify — plumbing, maybe, or ventilation, or the sound that buildings make when they are full of offices in which forms are being filled out by people who do not fully understand what the forms are for, which is most people, which is all of us, which is the point.

I picked up my pen. I uncapped it. I began.
