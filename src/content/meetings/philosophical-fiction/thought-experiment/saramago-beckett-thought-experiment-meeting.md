The room was wrong for a meeting. It was a hotel conference room in Lisbon, rented by the hour, with those fluorescent panels in the ceiling that turn everyone's skin the color of old paper. The table was too long for three people, so we had clustered at one end like passengers on a raft. Someone had left a carafe of water and three glasses. Two of the glasses had water spots. Saramago had taken the clean one without apology.

He was already talking when Beckett arrived. Not to me — to himself, or to the room, or to the idea he was holding. Saramago talked the way he wrote, in long sinuous loops that subordinated clause to clause, doubling back and then pressing forward, so that by the time the sentence ended you had forgotten its beginning, which was, I suspected, the point. Beckett came through the door with a coat too heavy for the weather and sat down and said nothing for several minutes, and the nothing he said was louder than Saramago's everything.

"The premise," I said, when there was a gap — not a silence, because Saramago did not produce silence, but a momentary thinning of sound, like a river narrowing between rocks. "Everyone in a city loses the ability to remember names. Not faces, not voices, not relationships. Just names. They know the person standing in front of them. They know the history, the feeling, the entire architecture of the connection. But the word is gone."

Saramago set down his glass. "Good," he said. "Because a name is not a small thing. A name is the handle by which society grips a person. Without the name you cannot summon, you cannot accuse, you cannot file, you cannot bury. The entire administrative apparatus of civilization depends on the correspondence between a person and a word. Remove the word and the apparatus grinds. It does not stop — these things never stop — but it grinds, and in the grinding you hear what the machine has been doing all along."

"Too much," Beckett said.

It was the first thing he had said, and it landed on the table like a stone dropped into a bowl.

"Too much?" Saramago turned toward him. He was a large man and the turning was deliberate, a reorientation of mass and attention.

"Too much already. You have a premise and you have already built the entire society around it. The administration, the filing, the burying. You have furnished the room before anyone has walked into it."

"The room must be furnished."

"The room must be empty. A man forgets his wife's name. That is the story. Not the city. Not the administration. A man standing in a kitchen unable to say the word that would bring her toward him. Everything else is — " He paused. The pause was not hesitation. It was selection, the careful choosing of one word from a field of possible words, most of which he had decided to leave unused. "Decoration."

Saramago laughed. It was not a dismissive laugh. It was the laugh of a man who has heard an argument he disagrees with completely and respects entirely. "Decoration," he said. "Samuel, the society is not decoration. The society is the body in which the individual lives. You cannot write about a man forgetting a name without writing about what names do. Names are the ligaments of the social body. Cut the ligaments — "

"And you have an allegory. Very clean. Very useful. Very dead."

I poured myself water from the carafe. My hand was not steady. I had expected disagreement but not the speed of it, the way these two had found each other's pressure points within minutes, as though they had been arguing for decades across a distance neither had bothered to close.

"What if it's both?" I said, and Beckett looked at me with an expression I will describe as patience, though that word is too kind. It was the expression of a man waiting for a younger person to finish saying the obvious thing so the conversation could resume.

"Both," he said. "Both is the refuge of the person who cannot choose."

"Or of the person who sees that the choice is false," Saramago said, and here he was defending me, which I did not want, because his defense was also a kind of annexation. "The man in the kitchen and the city losing its names — these are the same event at different magnifications. You look through one end of the telescope and see a man opening his mouth and producing silence where a name should be. You look through the other end and see a postal system collapsing because the letters cannot be addressed. These are not two stories. They are one story told at two scales."

Beckett shook his head. Not vigorously — he did nothing vigorously. The shake was minimal, almost a tremor. "Scale is the lie," he said. "You zoom out and you see patterns. You see systems. You see allegory. But the man in the kitchen is not a pattern. He is a man in a kitchen. His feet are cold. The linoleum has a crack he keeps meaning to fix. The light above the sink flickers. And he cannot say her name. That is not an allegory for anything. That is the whole catastrophe, right there, in three syllables he cannot find."

"Three syllables," Saramago repeated. "You have given her a three-syllable name."

"I have given her a name you will never hear, because the story is about its absence."

"But you know it."

"I know it. The man knows it. The reader never will."

I wrote in my notebook: *the name exists but is withheld.* This was different from the name being lost. Beckett was proposing something precise — a character who has the memory of the name's shape, its weight in the mouth, even the number of its syllables, but cannot convert that knowledge into sound. The word as phantom limb.

Saramago was watching me write. "You are taking his side," he said.

"I am taking notes."

"Notes are a form of allegiance."

"Then I am allied with both of you, and neither of you, and the notebook."

Saramago smiled. It was the smile of a man who is deciding whether to be offended and choosing not to, provisionally, for now. "Let me tell you what I see," he said. "I see the premise spreading. A fog. First one man cannot remember, then his neighbor, then the neighborhood, then the district. The spread is the story, because the spread is how you test a society. You do not know what a civilization is made of until you start removing pieces. I removed sight. The result was instructive. Remove names, and the instruction will be different. Perhaps worse. Sight is biological. Names are social. When you lose your sight, you lose contact with the physical world. When you lose names, you lose contact with the social one. And the social world is the one we built. The one we are responsible for."

"Responsible," Beckett said. He said it as though tasting something he was not sure he wanted to swallow.

"Yes. Responsible. There is a humanism in the premise that I will not apologize for. The question is not whether meaning exists. The question is what happens to people — real, suffering, defecating, eating, sleeping people — when a piece of the shared apparatus fails. And the answer is: they improvise. They find each other by other means. They invent new grammars of recognition. This is not optimism. It is observation. I have watched people. In wars, in plagues, in ordinary Tuesdays. They adapt. The adaptation is clumsy and incomplete and often ugly, but it is there, and it is human, and I will not write a story that pretends it is not."

Beckett did not respond immediately. He picked up his glass of water, held it at eye level, and looked through it at the fluorescent light, which wavered and bent through the glass like something seen through bad memory. Then he set it down.

"You have watched people," he said. "I have also watched people. What I see is different. I see the adaptation failing. I see the new grammar collapsing into the same incoherence as the old grammar. I see people reaching for each other across a gap that does not close, reaching and reaching, and the reaching itself becoming a habit, a tic, indistinguishable from the original problem. You call it improvisation. I call it repetition wearing a new coat."

"That is bleak."

"Bleak." He seemed to consider the word. "Bleak is what people say when they cannot dispute the observation so they dispute the tone. I am not bleak. I am accurate. The man cannot say her name. He tries again. He tries a third time. Each attempt is slightly less than the previous attempt. Not dramatically less — not a collapse. A diminishment. A wearing down. The word was three syllables. Now it is the ghost of three syllables. Now it is the intention to speak followed by a silence that has forgotten what it was going to replace. This is how language dies. Not in a catastrophe. In repetitions that each lose a little more than the last."

I felt the room shift. Not physically — the fluorescent lights were still humming their sick hum, the water carafe still half full, the table still too long. But something in the conversation had moved from argument to a place I did not have a word for. They were not agreeing. They were describing the same wound from opposite sides, and the descriptions were irreconcilable, and the irreconcilability was the truth of the thing.

"I want to talk about the body," I said. "Both of you keep coming back to it. Jose, your characters are always bodies first — they eat, they shit, they grope in the dark. Samuel, your characters are bodies falling apart — legs that don't work, mouths that can't stop or can't start. What happens to the body when the name goes?"

Saramago leaned back. The chair protested. "The body becomes the name," he said. "This is what happened in the ward, with the blind. When you cannot see, you identify by touch, by smell, by the particular sound of a person's breathing. The body becomes the signature. Remove names and something similar occurs. You recognize the way a person stands in a doorway. The angle of the shoulder. The particular rhythm of the footstep on the stair. These are not substitutes for the name. They are what the name was always covering up. The name is a shortcut. Remove the shortcut and you arrive at the person by the longer road."

"The longer road," Beckett repeated. "Yes. And the longer road is where I live. But I do not arrive. That is the difference between us, Jose. Your longer road has a destination. Mine does not. My man — Molloy, let us say, or any of the others, the names hardly matter, which is pertinent — my man walks and walks and the road does not lead anywhere because the road is not going anywhere. The road is the road. The walking is the walking. There is no arrival. There is only the continuation of the effort, and the effort becoming gradually less distinguishable from the stopping."

"There must be other people," Saramago said. "You cannot write about the loss of names and have only one man in a kitchen. The loss is social. It requires society."

"I can have two," Beckett said. "Two is sufficient. Two is already a society. Two people who cannot name each other — that is your entire allegory in miniature. They look at each other. They know each other. They have thirty years of shared meals and arguments and silences between them. And the word that would compress all of that into a summons, into a way of saying *you, across the room, come here, I need you* — the word is gone. Everything else remains. The thirty years remain. The knowledge remains. Only the handle is missing. And without the handle you cannot grip, and without gripping you cannot pull toward you, and without pulling toward you there is just the distance, and the distance was always there, underneath the name, and now it is visible."

I stopped writing. Not because I had run out of things to record, but because the act of recording felt like a betrayal of what was happening. The conversation had reached a place where transcription was a form of reduction, and I did not want to reduce it. I wanted to sit in it.

"Comedy," I said after a while. "There is comedy in this."

Beckett almost smiled. The almost was doing most of the work. "Of course there is comedy. A man opens his mouth to call his wife and what comes out is a vowel sound, a sort of lowing, and he stands there lowing like a cow in his own kitchen. That is funny. It is the funniest thing in the world. And the funniest things in the world are the things that cannot be fixed."

"I disagree about the cow," Saramago said.

"You disagree about the cow."

"The cow reduces the dignity of the moment."

"The dignity of the moment. Jose. Listen to me. There is no dignity in a man who cannot speak his wife's name. There is pathos, there is absurdity, there is something that sits between tragedy and farce so precisely that neither word applies. But dignity — dignity is what you bring to the moment because you want to rescue it. And the moment does not want to be rescued. The moment wants to be what it is: a man making a sound that is not a word in a room that used to be his home and is now just a room with a woman in it whose name he has lost."

"Whose name everyone has lost," Saramago corrected. "She has also lost his. This is critical. The loss is mutual. It is shared. It is not one man's private catastrophe. It is the species looking at itself in the mirror and discovering that the labels have dissolved. The face remains. The label is gone. And what the face means without the label — this is the question. This is the only question."

Beckett said nothing. This was not agreement. It was the kind of silence that occurs when someone has heard something they need time to metabolize, and the metabolizing will not happen in this room, in this conversation, but later, alone, in whatever spare and undecorated place Beckett went to think.

I looked at my notes. I had almost nothing written. Two phrases: *the name exists but is withheld* and *the distance was always there underneath.* The rest was in my body — a tension in the chest, a sense that the story I would write would have to hold two incompatible truths simultaneously: that language connects us and that language was always a screen we held up between ourselves and the fact of each other.

"The ending," I said, knowing I should not.

"There is no ending," Beckett said.

"There is always an ending," Saramago said. "People keep living. They find ways. They sit at the breakfast table and pass the salt without saying *pass the salt* and the salt arrives anyway, and the arriving of the salt is a form of hope so small that it would be embarrassing to call it hope, and yet there it is, the salt, in the hand, passed from one person to another who cannot be named and does not need to be."

"The salt," Beckett said.

"The salt."

"You want to end a story about the collapse of language with a man passing salt."

"I want to end a story about the collapse of language with the fact that the salt arrives. Despite everything. The salt arrives."

Beckett looked at the carafe of water. He picked it up. He poured water into his glass slowly, watching it fill. "The salt arrives," he said. "And the next morning he tries again to say her name and cannot. And the morning after. And the morning after that. The salt keeps arriving and the name keeps not arriving and neither of these facts cancels the other and neither of these facts explains the other and the man sits at the table with salt in his hand and silence where the word should be and this — this — is the human situation, which you want to call hope and I want to call endurance and which is probably neither, and probably both, and probably something else that we will not settle today."

"No," I said. "We will not settle it today."

Saramago poured himself more water. The carafe was nearly empty now — between the three of us we had consumed most of it without noticing, which seemed right, which seemed like the kind of thing that happens when you are talking about loss and do not notice what you are losing.

"The prose," he said. "We have not discussed the prose."

"The prose is the disagreement," Beckett said. "You want sentences that fill rooms. I want sentences that empty them. You want to hold the reader inside a period that lasts half a page, clause folding into clause, the way consciousness actually moves, which is your argument, that consciousness is continuous, that the comma is more honest than the period. I want the period. I want the sentence to end. I want the silence after the sentence, which is where meaning lives — not in the words but in the space between the words, in the gap, in the place where the reader is alone with what was just said and cannot yet move to what will be said next."

"The gap," Saramago said. "You keep invoking the gap. My entire career has been an argument against the gap. The gap is where things fall. People fall into gaps. I build bridges over gaps. Long, winding, sometimes exhausting bridges, yes, bridges that take half a page to cross, but bridges, because the alternative is the gap, and the gap is where we lose each other."

"And I," Beckett said, buttoning his coat, which he had never unbuttoned, "live in the gap."

He stood. He did not say goodbye, because goodbye is a word, and words were the thing we had been arguing about, and using one to end the argument would have been a concession neither of them was prepared to make. He left the room. The door stayed open.

Saramago looked at the open door. He looked at me. He looked at the empty carafe.

"He is not wrong about the cow," he said.

I gathered my notebook. In the hallway I could hear the elevator arriving, late, irrelevant, its mechanism groaning behind the wall like something trying to say a word it had forgotten.
