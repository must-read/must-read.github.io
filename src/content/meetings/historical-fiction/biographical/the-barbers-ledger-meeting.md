The barbershop is closed, or rather it was never open — this one exists only as a meeting place for us, a narrow room with two chairs and a mirror and that particular smell of bay rum and tallow that I can almost manufacture if I think hard enough. The light comes through a window that faces south, which is wrong for D Street in Washington but right for the quality of afternoon I want: long amber bars across a pine floor. Mantel arrived first. She is sitting in one of the barber's chairs, not the customer's side but the barber's, as if she'd already decided whose position interests her. Jones came in a few minutes later, took off his coat slowly, looked at the bottles on the shelf, and sat down in the other chair without being asked.

I am standing. I don't know where to put my hands.

"The ledger," Mantel says, not as an opening but as if we've already been talking for an hour. "That's where it lives. The double book. One for the public and one for the self. Thomas Cromwell kept accounts — he was a man of accounts, a man who understood that columns of numbers are a form of power. Your barber knows this too."

"He's not keeping accounts of power," Jones says. "He's keeping accounts of people."

"Which is the same thing."

"No." Jones leans back. He has a way of disagreeing that doesn't raise his voice or narrow his eyes — he simply places the word down like a stone on a table. "No, it isn't. Power is what the senator has when he sits in the chair. What Solomon has is memory. And memory is not power. Memory is obligation."

I try to say something about the difference between public and private record, about how the two ledgers might function as —

"Don't theorize it," Mantel says, looking at me. "That's the first mistake. You start theorizing the double ledger and you've written an essay. What does the ink smell like? What does his hand feel like at the end of a day of writing? The cramp in the fingers, the tallow under the nails. The book is a physical object. It lives in a flour barrel. It smells like flour. Start there."

She's right, and I know she's right, and I also know that what she's describing — the physical reality of the hidden book — is only half of what I need. I tell her this. She looks at me as if I've said something mildly interesting.

"The other half," Jones says, "is what he chooses not to write."

This stops the conversation for a moment. Through the window — my invented window — the afternoon light shifts. Somewhere outside, a cart passes. I've written that into the scene already, in my head: cobblestones, the sound of wheels. The fact that I'm already furnishing the world worries me. I'm decorating before I have the structure.

"Tell me about the barber's silence," I say to Jones. "The story needs him to be silent in front of white men. Not just cautious — silent in a way that constitutes its own kind of action. But I'm afraid of making the silence too heroic. Too knowing."

Jones looks at the mirror. "A man who shaves other men's throats for a living knows more than he should. That's not heroism. That's proximity. He's close to the body. The neck, the jaw, the pulse. White men in that chair are more vulnerable than they are anywhere else in their lives, and they don't fully realize it, and the barber knows they don't realize it, and he uses that not-realizing as a kind of space. The space is where he breathes."

"But he has the razor," Mantel says. "Against the throat. Every single day. And the reader needs to feel that — the weight of the blade, the pulse under it, the fact that this free Black man holds a sharp edge against the neck of a man who considers him less than human. That is the political situation of the entire antebellum South compressed into a single gesture. If you don't make the reader feel the razor, you've lost the story."

"I don't want the razor to be a symbol," Jones says.

"I'm not saying symbol. I'm saying sensation. The reader needs to feel it in their own throat."

"Fine. But the moment you make the reader feel the razor as threat, you've turned Solomon into a man who is thinking about cutting. And he's not thinking about cutting. He's thinking about the shave. He's thinking about the angle and the soap and whether the blade needs stropping. That's his work. It's dignified work. The razor is a tool, not a weapon."

"It's both," Mantel says.

"It's a tool first."

I am watching them disagree and trying to find my own position, which is somewhere between: the razor matters because the physical world matters, but it must not become the central image. It's one element. The ledger is another. The shop itself — the narrowness of it, the mirror, the arrangement of bottles that Solomon maintains with a precision his customers mistake for vanity. Each of these objects carries weight but none of them should be allowed to dominate.

"The bottles," I say. "He arranges them precisely. And the story says his customers mistake this for vanity. But actually it's — "

"Survival," Jones says. "Disorder invites scrutiny. He's learned that. Every free Black person in that city has learned that. Your house is clean, your papers are in order, your shop is arranged. Because the moment something looks wrong, someone with authority notices, and being noticed is dangerous."

"Thomas More kept his house in perfect order," Mantel says. "While planning his own destruction. There's a similarity — the precision of a man who knows the cost of error."

"More chose his martyrdom," Jones says. "Solomon is not choosing anything. He's navigating."

"Cromwell, then. Cromwell navigated. Cromwell walked into rooms full of men who wanted him dead and he read their faces and he said the right thing and he survived. Your barber does the same."

"Cromwell had power. Real power. He could send men to the Tower. Solomon can send no one anywhere. Solomon's only power is that he is not noticed."

Mantel is quiet for a moment. This is a concession, though she won't name it as one. "The consciousness," she says. "We're inside his consciousness. Present tense. That's where the energy comes from — not from the razor or the ledger but from the quality of his attention. He sees everything. He reads Toombs's mood from the way he sits. He reads Bowen's intentions from the ink on his fingers. He's a reader of people, and we are reading his readings, and that creates a density that — " She pauses. "That's what I know how to build. A mind in a room, noticing."

"But the mind has limits," Jones says. "And the limits matter. He doesn't know what will happen to Jeremiah's wife. He doesn't know that Ruth will be sold to Alabama. He doesn't know any of the futures. He only knows the present — the candle, the pen, the names. And the story needs to hold both: what he knows and what he can't know. What the ledger contains and what it will never contain."

This is the thing I've been trying to articulate, and Jones has said it better than I could. The gap between the record and the reality. Solomon writes down names — Ruth, James, Anna — and the names are real, but the names cannot save anyone. The ledger is an act of witness, not an act of rescue. And the question the story has to sit inside, without answering, is whether witness is enough. Whether writing it down matters when the people you're writing about are being sold and separated and lost.

"I think," I say carefully, "that the story shouldn't answer that question."

"Obviously," Mantel says.

"But it should feel the question," Jones says. "Solomon should feel it. Not as an idea — as a pressure. Physical. In his chest, in his hands. The question of whether the ledger matters should feel like the question of whether his freedom will hold. Both are uncertain. Both keep him awake."

"There's a journalist," I say. "A man from the National Era. He wants Solomon to be part of the networks — the underground routes. And Solomon refuses. Not out of cowardice but out of a precise understanding of what it would cost him. And the journalist can't grasp that because the journalist's risk is different in kind. Not just in degree — in kind."

"That's the scene I'd write longest," Mantel says. "The two of them in the shop. The journalist performing his righteousness. And Solomon watching the performance and understanding exactly what it is and naming it — not out loud, never out loud — but in his own mind, in the ledger, later. The alchemy by which another person's danger becomes moral refinement. I'd want that phrase. Exactly that."

"But the journalist isn't a villain," Jones says. "He's not wrong to want what he wants. The routes existed. People risked their lives. The problem isn't his cause. The problem is that he can't see Solomon as someone with his own calculus, his own ledger of risk and gain. He sees Solomon as a resource. An asset. A source."

"Which is another form of the same blindness," I say.

Jones gives me a look. Not disagreement — more like caution. "Be careful with that. The journalist's blindness and the senator's blindness are not the same. They share a structure, maybe. But if you make them equivalent, you've written a story that says the abolitionist and the slaveholder are the same, and that's — "

"Not what I mean."

"I know. But the story might say it anyway, if you're not careful. Stories do that. They find the easy symmetry and they settle into it. The abolitionist who can't see the man in front of him, the slaveholder who can't see the man behind him — it's a neat equation. Too neat. The story needs to be messier than that."

"Make the journalist leave," Mantel says. "Have him go to Philadelphia. Let Solomon read about it in the paper. And Solomon's reaction — is it relief? Is it contempt? Is it the smallest thread of regret? Don't decide. Let the character decide, in the moment, on the page, and let the decision surprise you."

I ask about the mother. Dorothea. The woman who gave Solomon his middle name — Once — and told him: *You are free, but only once. They can take it back.* I want this to be the emotional spine of the story. The instruction that Solomon carries like a pocket Bible.

"Don't overuse it," Jones says. "If Solomon thinks about his mother's words every other page, it becomes a refrain, and refrains are comfortable, and this man is not comfortable. Let the words come when they come. Once near the beginning. Once near the end. And never with the same meaning."

"The name itself," Mantel says. "Once. A middle name that is not a surname but a word. That's extraordinary. That's the kind of detail that makes a reader stop and re-read the sentence. Don't explain it too quickly. Let the reader sit with the strangeness of it before the mother's explanation arrives."

I tell them about the ending I have in mind — or rather, the ending I don't have in mind. I know the story doesn't end with rescue or ruin. It ends with the ledger being closed and put back in the barrel. It ends with the unfinished Capitol dome, open to the sky. But I'm afraid the dome image is too tidy. Too symbolic. The broken republic, the exposed machinery of government — it's almost editorial.

"Then don't editorialize," Mantel says. "Let Solomon see it. On his walk. Let him look at the dome the way he looks at everything else — with that quality of noticing that does not announce its significance. If he sees the dome and the prose tells us what the dome means, you've failed. If he sees the dome and the prose tells us what the light looks like on the exposed ironwork at four in the afternoon, you might have something."

"The dome was actually under construction in those years," Jones says. "The old wooden one came down in fifty-three, fifty-four. The new iron one wasn't finished until after the war. So for a decade, the Capitol sat there open. And everyone in Washington could see it. And nobody wrote about what it was like for a free Black man to walk past the unfinished seat of a government that was actively debating whether people like him were property."

"Nobody recorded it," I say.

"Nobody recorded a great deal." Jones crosses his arms. His voice has not changed — it is the same patient, flat, expansive voice he's used the entire conversation — but something has tightened behind it. "That's the story. Not the dome. Not the razor. Not the journalist. The story is that nobody recorded it, and your man — Solomon — is trying to. With a pen and a candle and a book hidden in a flour barrel. And he doesn't know if anyone will ever read it. And he does it anyway."

We sit with that for a while. The light in my invented barbershop has shifted to late afternoon, almost evening. The amber bars on the floor have stretched into long shadows. Mantel picks up a brush from the shelf and turns it in her hands, feeling the bristles, the wood, the weight of it.

"One more thing," she says. "The woman. Adelaide. He's courting her carefully, like a man defusing something. I love that. But don't resolve the courtship. Don't let the reader know whether it works. The courtship is another ledger — another set of calculations, risks, costs. He hasn't told her about the book. That's not about trust. That's about not wanting to make her into a co-conspirator. Which is its own kind of love. The kind that protects by withholding."

"Or the kind that diminishes by withholding," Jones says.

Mantel looks at him. "Both."

"Both," Jones agrees. It may be the first thing they've fully agreed on in an hour.

I don't know how to end this conversation, so I don't. Jones puts his coat back on. Mantel sets the brush down, not where she found it but one inch to the left, and I think Solomon would notice that, and I think he would move it back after she left, and I think the act of moving it back — the precision, the order, the survival — would say everything the story needs to say about who he is.

But I don't say this. I just watch them go.
