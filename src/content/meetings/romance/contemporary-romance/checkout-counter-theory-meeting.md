The pub was Emily's idea. She'd picked it based on a photo of the beer garden — fairy lights, a crooked wisteria, one of those chalk menus where someone had drawn a little sheep next to the lamb shank. "I need a setting that commits to being charming," she said, when I asked why we weren't just doing this over Zoom. "If we're going to argue about a love story, I want to be somewhere that smells like Sunday roast."

Talia was already there when we arrived, sitting in a corner booth with a pot of tea and a notebook, looking like she'd been ready for this conversation for about three hours. She had an actual pen. A nice one. I suddenly felt underprepared, which I was.

"Right," Talia said, not looking up. "So. A woman crashes into a man's life, literally. There's a B&B. There's forced proximity. We're doing this, then."

"We're doing it," Emily said, sliding into the booth. She ordered a pint before sitting down fully, which I respected. "The question is how we're doing it. Because forced proximity can be the laziest structural choice in romance or the most interesting one, and the difference is about four sentences of honest interiority."

"The difference," Talia said, "is whether you treat the proximity as the mechanism or the metaphor. If two people are stuck together and all that generates is sexual tension, you've written a sitcom. If they're stuck together and the stuckness reveals something neither of them wanted revealed — that's a story."

I opened my own notebook. I'd written some thoughts on the plane. They now seemed extremely thin. "I was thinking about the idea of systems," I said. "A man who runs on systems. Schedules, rules, routines. And a woman who's — I don't want to say she's chaos, because that's reductive —"

"It is reductive," Talia said, setting down her tea. "It's the oldest trope in the disability playbook, actually. Rigid autistic person meets free-spirited neurotypical who teaches them to loosen up. Feel the sunshine. Learn to be spontaneous." She said this flatly, without venom, which made it worse. "If we're writing a neurodivergent character whose arc is learning to be less neurodivergent, I'd rather not."

Emily leaned forward. "I agree with that. Completely. But I don't think the opposite move is to make the routines invisible, either. They have to be visible. They have to matter. The question is whether they're treated as limitations or as — what's the word —"

"Infrastructure," Talia said.

"Yes. Infrastructure. The routines are how he keeps standing. And she has to see that."

"She has to do more than see it," Talia said. "She has to find it interesting. Not in a patronizing way. Actually interesting. Like — oh, you fold napkins into thirds because thirds produce a more balanced fold, and that detail tells me something real about how your mind works, and I want to know more."

I wrote that down. Napkins. Thirds. Then crossed it out because I didn't want to just transcribe, I wanted to understand.

"Okay," I said. "So the B&B is his territory. He built the system. She walks into it and — what? She follows the rules?"

Emily shook her head. "No. She breaks them. But not because she's careless. Because she's drowning in something she can't name, and his rules are the first solid thing she's touched in months." She paused. "I want her to be a writer. A romance novelist. Someone whose job is to believe in love, and who's stopped being able to do that."

"Why?" Talia asked.

"Family. Her parents. Something that made her doubt the evidence she'd been building her entire career on. She writes love, but the love she grew up watching was — performed. Faked. And she's still excavating that."

Talia was quiet for a moment. She turned her pen between her fingers. "That's good. That's actually good. Because then the dare matters."

"The dare?"

"There has to be a dare. A wager. Something that forces them into each other's genre." Talia smiled. "She writes romance; he doesn't write at all. But she dares him to try. And he dares her to write something without a happy ending. Literary fiction. Something that hurts."

Emily practically vibrated. "Yes. The genre swap. She writes something raw and unstructured and terrifying, and he writes — what does he write?"

"A love story," Talia said. "In section headers. With timestamps."

The table went quiet. I could see it: this exacting, methodical man sitting down to write a romance the only way he knew how, with the same precision he brought to everything else. Not despite the structure, but through it.

"He writes himself," Emily said softly. "That's the vulnerability. He hands her a story about a guesthouse owner and a woman who shows up uninvited, and it's so clearly about them that it's unbearable."

"And it's good," Talia added. "Not polished, not professionally good. Good the way a first draft by someone who's never written fiction is good: clumsy and completely honest. No defenses. He doesn't know the tricks yet, so he can't hide behind them."

I was writing fast. "What about the physical space? The B&B itself — does it matter what it looks like, where it is?"

"Cotswolds," Talia said immediately. "Stone walls. Gardens that look like someone planned them four centuries ago. The kind of English that Americans find almost aggressively picturesque."

Emily raised her eyebrows. "You want the American romance novelist in the Cotswolds."

"I want the fish out of water. I want her driving on the wrong side of the road and rear-ending a stone wall."

"That's a strong opening."

"It's a physical metaphor she doesn't realize she's living. She crashes into his world. Literally. Damages his property on the way in. And he comes out with a clipboard." Talia grinned. "He comes out in the rain, without an umbrella, because he rushed outside specifically to be furious. And he has a clipboard with a pen on a string."

Emily laughed. "The pen on a string. That's the whole character."

"The pen on a string is the character," Talia agreed. "The clipboard is the cope. But the pen on a string — that's someone who's been burned by not having a pen when he needed one, and has engineered a solution that's slightly over-the-top, and doesn't care what it looks like because it works."

I asked something that had been bothering me. "How do we keep her from being a manic pixie? She's the chaos element in his ordered life. That's dangerous territory."

Emily set down her pint. "She's not chaos. She's stuck. There's a huge difference. Chaos is bouncy and energetic and life-giving. She's paralyzed. She can't write. She hasn't written a usable sentence in months. She came to this B&B because her agent threatened her career, and she's sitting in beautiful rooms opening a laptop and staring at a cursor."

"So she's not disrupting his system because she's wild and free," I said. "She's disrupting it because she's broken in a way that doesn't fit his categories."

"Exactly." Emily leaned back. "She asks about towels on the wrong day just to watch his face do the processing thing. Not because she's quirky. Because she's testing whether he's real. She's spent a year discovering that people perform emotions they don't feel, and she's looking for anyone who can't fake it."

Talia was nodding slowly. "And he can't. That's the thing about his character. He literally cannot fake it. Autistic people — and I'm speaking broadly, everyone's different — but there's this thing where neurotypical people perform social smoothness, and autistic people often can't or won't. And she's come from a world where the smoothness was a lie. So his bluntness, his inability to do small talk, his insistence on saying exactly what he means — that's not an obstacle. It's proof."

"Proof of what?" I asked.

"That he's real. That when he remembers she pushes the beans aside and serves them in a separate ramekin the next day, it's not performance. It's attention. It's how he loves: through precision."

Emily had gone quiet, which I was learning meant she was thinking about something important. She traced a circle on the table with her finger.

"I want the father thing to land hard," she said finally. "Not as backstory. Not as a reveal that explains everything. I want it to sit in her chest the whole time, this weight she can't put down. Her father was the one who taught her to believe in love. He danced with her mother in the kitchen. And then she found out he had a whole other family. Not an affair — a family. Kids. In New Jersey."

Talia exhaled. "God."

"Right. So the question isn't does love exist. The question is can she trust her own perception of it. Every romance she's ever written feels contaminated now. The genre itself is suspect. She's lost faith not in love but in her ability to recognize it."

"Which is why the dare works," Talia said. "He says she should write something without a happy ending, and she can. She sits down and the prose comes out fast and angry and spare. Not romance. Something about a woman driving to New Jersey at night, looking for a house she's never seen."

"And it's good. Better than what she's been writing."

"Which scares her."

"Which should scare her."

I jumped in, because I had something and I wasn't sure how long I'd have it. "But his story — the one he writes — is the counterweight. He writes a romance without any of the tricks. No banter, no witty observations, no craft. Just a man describing, in precise language, what it feels like when someone notices you. And because he's never written fiction, he doesn't know to protect himself. It's just — there."

Emily looked at me. "You want the reader to cry."

"I want the reader to forget they're reading."

Talia shook her head. "No, that's too clean. I want the reader to feel the clumsiness. He's structured it like a report. There are headers. There might be bullet points. And that's exactly why it works — because the form is so rigid and the content is so exposed. The gap between how he's organized it and what he's actually saying is where the emotion lives."

"The gap is the story," Emily said. "That's true for both of them, actually. She's stuck between the genre she writes and the truth she's living. He's stuck between the system he's built and the thing he feels. And the dare forces them both into the gap."

A silence settled over the table. Not uncomfortable. The kind of silence where three people have arrived at something and need a moment to stand in it.

Then Talia said: "I have a concern."

"Go."

"The ending. I don't want it to solve her father thing. I don't want Elliott to say something wise that heals her. That's not how it works and it's not fair to either of them."

Emily nodded. "Agreed. The father thing doesn't get solved. She names it. She says it out loud, to someone who doesn't rush to comfort her. And he says something that reframes it — not fixes it. He says something like, your father wasn't faking, he was doing it wrong, those are different things. And it shifts something, but it doesn't resolve anything."

"A window," I said. "Not a door."

"Don't be poetic at me," Emily said, but she was smiling. "A window works, though. Air gets in. That's all. The crack is enough."

Talia was writing something in her notebook. She wrote for a while, and Emily and I watched, because it seemed rude to interrupt someone having a thought that required that much penmanship.

"Laminated rules," Talia said, finally. "That's where I keep coming back to. He laminates his rules. For the B&B, for his routines, for his life. And she comes in and she doesn't tear them up — she reads them. She actually reads them. And she asks questions about them. Why 8:15 instead of 8:00? Why thirds instead of halves? And each answer is a door into him."

"A window," I corrected.

"Shut up," she said, warmly.

Emily was peeling the label off her pint glass, which I was fairly sure she didn't realize she was doing. "The thing I keep worrying about," she said, "is making it too interior. Two people in a house for six weeks, both in their heads, both processing family trauma and disability and creative block. It could become airless. We need — the village. The garden. The rain. Physical things that ground them in a world that exists outside their feelings."

"The library," Talia said. "He keeps his personal books on the guest shelves because rooms look better with books. And she finds Ishiguro shelved with literary fiction, not Nobel winners, and she knows there's no Nobel section and he wouldn't make one because it's a marketing category, not a real genre, and she knows him. From one shelving decision."

"That's where they kiss," Emily said. "Between Ishiguro and Baldwin."

"Obviously."

"In the rain?"

"The rain is outside. They're in the library. But yes, it's raining. It's the Cotswolds. It's always raining."

I looked at my notebook. I had pages of notes, most of them half-sentences and words circled with arrows pointing to other words. Clipboard. New Jersey. Thirds. The gap. Infrastructure. I didn't have a plot. I had something better — I had the negative space between two people who were both, in completely different ways, afraid of being truly perceived, and who were about to perceive each other anyway.

"One more thing," I said. "The title. I've been thinking about checkout counters. Not literally — metaphorically. She has this theory about romance: that love is a transaction. You present yourself at the counter, someone scans you, decides your value. Her father's betrayal proved the theory — he was checked out by one person while simultaneously being checked by another. The whole system was fraudulent."

Emily considered this. "And Elliott?"

"Elliott doesn't have a checkout counter. He has a clipboard. He doesn't transact — he inventories. He writes things down not to assess them but to keep them real. He timestamps not because he's calculating but because he doesn't want to forget."

Talia leaned forward. "So she has to learn that love isn't a transaction. And he has to learn that his inventory — his documentation of the world — is a kind of love letter."

"And the story is called 'Checkout Counter Theory' because it's her theory, and the whole story is about why it's wrong."

"Or about why it's right in a way she didn't expect," Emily said. "Checkout doesn't have to mean transaction. It can mean checkout as in — leaving. Departing. The moment you decide to go. And she keeps not leaving."

I hadn't thought of that. I wrote it down.

Talia finished her tea. She turned the cup upside down on the saucer, which I was fairly sure was a thing people did with Turkish coffee to read the grounds, but this was English breakfast tea, so she might have just been being odd.

"I want the last image to be his clipboard," she said. "He writes her name. He writes STAYING. He timestamps it. Because that's his love language — recording the facts of a thing, making them official, putting them in a system so they can't be lost."

Emily was quiet.

"He's wearing the apron," Emily said after a moment. "The terrible one. The Comic Sans one. And she didn't win the bet. He's wearing it because he wants to."

"Because he's choosing to be ridiculous," Talia said. "And he's never done that before."

I closed my notebook. I had enough. More than enough — I had the two images that would bookend the story, I had the emotional architecture, I had the sounds of both their voices in my ears. What I didn't have was any certainty about the middle, about how to pace the six weeks so they felt lived-in rather than summarized, about whether the New Jersey thing should surface early or late, about how much of his writing to show on the page.

Emily must have read something on my face. "You don't have to solve it all now," she said. "That's not what this is for."

"What is this for?"

"Charging the battery. You go in knowing what the story sounds like, even if you don't know what happens in it."

Talia was already putting on her coat. "I disagree," she said. "I think this is for finding the one question the story has to answer. And I think we found it."

"Which is?"

She looked at me like the answer should have been obvious. "Can attention be enough? Not grand gestures, not declarations, not sweeping romance. Just — someone who notices you put the beans aside, and remembers, and puts them in a separate ramekin, and never once asks you to explain why."

Emily pulled on her jacket. "That's not a question. That's a thesis."

"Same thing, when it's good."

They left separately — Talia toward the car park, Emily toward the village, saying something about wanting to see if the bookshop was still open. I sat in the booth for a while longer, reading my notes, trying to hear the story under all the conversation. It was there, I thought. Somewhere between the clipboard and the crash, between the napkin folds and the New Jersey highway, between a man who documented everything and a woman who'd stopped trusting documents.

The barman collected Talia's upside-down teacup and gave me a look.

I ordered another drink and kept reading.
