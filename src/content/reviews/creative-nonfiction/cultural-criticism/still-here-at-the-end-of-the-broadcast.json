      "text": "The essay's fragmentary structure earns its form — each section functions as its own broadcast, its own signal, and the white space between them enacts the dissolution the essay describes. The Didion inheritance is handled with more sophistication than most attempts: the Santa Ana winds, the clinical catalogs, the controlled anxiety are all present without becoming pastiche. Where the essay is strongest is in its insistence that Black performance constitutes the American signal rather than merely appearing on it. The Don Cornelius section, particularly the passage about his suicide, achieves genuine moral weight. My reservation is that the Oakland bar scene verges on the sentimental — strangers singing together as momentary communion is an image that has been used before, and this essay does not quite rescue it from familiarity.",

      "text": "There is real craft here — the sentence about the house key that no longer fits any lock is precise and well-made, and the Marvin Gaye passage about pressing your ear to the floor has genuine rhythmic authority. But the essay has a tic: it keeps telling you what it is trying to say. 'What I am trying to say, and keep failing to say, which may be the point' is the kind of metacommentary that substitutes self-awareness for arrival. Didion never told you what she was trying to say. She said it. The performance catalog runs long — Prince in the rain, Beyonce at Coachella — and each entry earns diminishing returns. Cut two of those and the section breathes.",

      "text": "What interests me is the essay's spatial architecture. Los Angeles and Oakland and Columbus, Ohio operate not as settings but as receiving stations — places where the broadcast arrives differently. The aunt's living room in Columbus, where the narrator tries to replicate a Soul Train dance and falls, is the essay's warmest moment and also its most formally revealing: the body as critic, the fall as the beginning of criticism. I am less convinced by the Didion passages, which feel dutiful — as if the essay knows it must pay tribute before it can move on to what it actually wants to discuss, which is Black performance. The essay is better when it stops triangulating between Didion's signal and its own and simply listens to the music.",

      "text": "I read this aloud to my partner and we both got quiet at the Don Cornelius section. The idea that performance is 'choosing which truth to broadcast, and the choice itself is an act of love' stopped me cold. The whole essay has this quality of thinking in real time, of a mind working through something it cannot quite resolve, and the fragments feel less like artistic choice and more like honesty — the writer giving you the pieces because the pieces are what she has. The ending, with the kid on the bus playing music without headphones as a kind of rude, beautiful broadcast, made me laugh and then made me sad and then made me hopeful, which is a lot for one paragraph to do.",

      "text": "The essay's sharpest argument is implicit rather than stated: that the fragmentation of American media is not a neutral technological shift but a political event with specific consequences for communities whose survival depended on shared signals. The broadcast, in this essay's telling, was always compromised — built on exclusion, shaped by capital — but it was also the only infrastructure of communal attention that existed, and its dissolution left certain populations more isolated than others. I wish the essay had pushed this structural analysis further. The Don Cornelius passage approaches it, and the LLC-in-Delaware echo from the bar scene gestures toward it, but the essay ultimately prefers the lyric mode to the analytical, which is a legitimate choice but also, perhaps, a limitation.",

      "text": "The fragment form works here in a way it does not always work in cultural criticism — each section is genuinely discontinuous, not just a continuous argument broken into pieces for aesthetic effect. The catalogs (businesses on Myrtle, performances on the phone) carry different formal charges: one inventories loss, the other inventories devotion. The aunt's iced-tea moment is the essay's secret hinge — comedy and the body and criticism all collapsing into one image. My one note: the Abdurraqib-inflected warmth and the Didion-inflected dread coexist productively through most of the essay but resolve too neatly at the end. 'Love, peace, and soul' as a closing line is earned, but I wanted the essay to sit longer in the dissonance.",

      "text": "I used to watch Soul Train at my grandmother's apartment in Bensonhurst. She was Italian, not Black, but she loved that show. She loved the dancing. She said Don Cornelius was the most elegant man on television and she was right. This essay gets at something real about what it felt like when we all stopped watching the same things. The part about the algorithm knowing your sadness better than your spouse — that hit me. And the kid on the bus with no headphones, being rude and being generous at the same time. I know that kid. He rides the B63.",

      "text": "The essay positions Black performance as 'the signal' of American culture, which is a powerful claim, but one that risks reproducing a familiar dynamic: Black art valued primarily for what it does for the national narrative rather than on its own terms. The essay is aware of this risk — the passage about the broadcast always being 'two broadcasts' gestures toward it — but awareness is not the same as resolution. Didion's position as cultural diagnostician is both invoked and implicitly critiqued, which is productive, but I wanted the essay to be more explicit about what it means for a non-Black writer to adopt the Didion-witness position toward Black performance. Who is watching whom, and from where? The essay raises this question structurally without ever confronting it directly.",

      "text": "Reading this from Dublin, I was struck by how deeply American the essay is and yet how legible its grief. The loss of a shared signal is not unique to the United States — we have our own version in Ireland, the end of the single-channel RTE era — but the essay's specific claim, that Black performance constituted the signal's conscience, is distinctly and powerfully American. The prose moves between Didion's taut, dry-mouthed precision and a warmer, more associative mode that feels like Abdurraqib's — the aunt's living room, the bar in Oakland, the kid on the bus. The transition between these registers is handled with real grace. The sentence 'the body remembers, the body does not need a broadcast to know what it knows' is the essay's thesis and its best line, and I admire that it arrives not as argument but as rhythm.",
