      "text": "The structural gambit — multiple beginnings that refuse to converge — is Calvino's gift, and it is well-used here. What surprised me is how much the Camus register carries. The passages about Dahl in the hallway, the fly on the glass, the coffee cooling: these are Meursault's observations recalibrated for a man whose crime is not indifference to a funeral but indifference to narrative closure. The committee scene where he explains stopping because the boat was nearly finished is the strongest moment. Where the piece falters slightly is in the direct address to the reader, which sometimes tells us what the structure is already showing. The line about the book and I being in the same room but no longer in the same country, though — that earns its keep.",

      "text": "The Calvino half is confident — the nested beginnings, the second-person address, the self-aware formal play. The Camus half is where I have doubts. Camus's prose achieves its philosophical weight through radical plainness: the sun, the gunshot, the sand. Here the plainness is occasionally invaded by a literary self-consciousness that Meursault would never tolerate. Dahl's explanation of why he stops reading is too articulate for a man modeled on the Stranger's emotional register. That said, the secretary Farah is a genuinely good invention. Her observation about the word 'surfaced' does more philosophical work than the reader-address passages.",

      "text": "Wild concept, actually pulled it off. A story about a guy on trial for not finishing books, told by a story that keeps restarting and not finishing. I got the Calvino thing right away but what hooked me was the Camus vibe — Dahl just sitting there watching dust in sunlight while a committee tells him he's deficient. The bit about the boat he didn't want to see completed is weirdly relatable. Read the whole thing on the bus. Irony noted.",

      "text": "The formal ambition is genuine: a Calvino-esque architecture of interrupted beginnings carrying Camus's philosophical content about the absurdity of social performance. The committee-as-trial mapping to The Stranger's courtroom is appropriate and mostly effective. But I question whether the story fully earns its metafictional moves. Calvino's second-person address in If on a winter's night works because the reader is genuinely uncertain what kind of book they are reading. Here, the address to the reader feels more like commentary on a structure we can already see. The Farah section is the strongest — a perspective genuinely external to Dahl's consciousness, which is where the Camus influence should live. The ending, with its multiple closings that refuse to close, is formally correct but emotionally thinner than the boat passage.",

      "text": "What I appreciate most is that this story trusts its own premise. Dahl is not a rebel or a philosopher — he is a man who notices things, and the noticing pulls him out of books. That plainness is Camus at his best. The structure pays genuine homage to Calvino without descending into pastiche: the beginnings don't feel like tricks, they feel like honest attempts to tell a story that resists being told one way. The detail about the water fountain dripping at intervals just irregular enough to prevent prediction is the kind of sentence I underline. Small, exact, doing double work.",

      "text": "Oh, I loved this. Dahl is such a particular and real person — his punctuality, his patience, the way he watches the fly clean its legs. He is not making a statement by not finishing books. He is simply being honest about what happens to him when he reads, and the honesty is treated as a crime. The committee reminded me of every institution that demands you explain what cannot be explained. And the ending — you are free to close this page — gave me a shiver.",

      "text": "Structurally interesting. The Calvino frame — restarting beginnings, reader address — is handled with enough restraint that it doesn't become mere gimmick. The Camus register is strongest in the physical details: the egg, the linoleum, the dust. Where the two influences meet least convincingly is in Dahl's longer explanations. Meursault's power is in what he does not say. Dahl says too much. The secretary section is the most formally precise: a consciousness recording another consciousness without fully understanding it. That is where the story lives.",

      "text": "A story about not finishing things that you absolutely must finish. It keeps rebooting itself like a glitchy program and somehow that IS the point. The boat passage — stopping before it's done because completion kills possibility — hit me right in the chest. Dahl is my new favorite literary character. He'd hate that I said that.",

      "text": "There is a clinical term for what Dahl describes — depersonalization, the sudden awareness of one's own consciousness as separate from the activity one is performing. But this story treats it not as pathology but as a kind of radical honesty. Dahl surfaces from reading the way my patients surface from dissociation: blinking, confused, more present than they were a moment before. The committee's insistence that he explain his interiority mirrors so many institutional encounters I have witnessed — the demand that an experience be translated into the language of the system that cannot hold it. The coffee detail, repeated throughout, is a perfect grounding object. That specificity — this coffee, this light, this morning — is what Dahl clings to, and the story is wise enough to let it be enough.",
