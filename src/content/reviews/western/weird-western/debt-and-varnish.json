      "text": "Three-voice structure is a gamble that usually fails — you get tonal whiplash and a narrator who exists only to explain things to the reader. This one pulls it off because the voices don't agree. Dorotea's sections are laconic to the point of cruelty: \"I stop thinking about them. That's not cruelty. That's housekeeping.\" The middle voice is almost unbearably baroque in contrast, all peristaltic patience and microbial congregations, and it earns that excess because the canyon isn't metaphorical — it's a physical thing that eats people. Gage walking out backward, counting steps, rifle as grammar: I haven't seen a Western protagonist escape a supernatural threat by holding onto the syntax of being a man with a gun. That's a new thing. The dark spot on his palm that won't wash off is the ending the story deserves — not resolution, not transformation, just a receipt. McCarthy would call this honest.",

      "text": "The multiple-voice structure here is doing something I haven't seen a weird western pull off before — the canyon sections shift into a prose register so dense and peristaltic that the genre friction becomes the horror. Dorotea's voice is bone-dry and load-bearing; she tells you everything without explaining anything. The line 'Faces are liars' after Gage walks out backward is the story in miniature. And the dark spot on his palm as a 'receipt' — that final image does what the best weird fiction does: gives the supernatural transaction an administrative clarity that's more unsettling than any monster. My one hesitation is that the varnish man's morphine-voice scene could have been shorter — it telegraphs what the ending earns on its own. But that's a small complaint against something genuinely strange.",

      "text": "The three-voice structure earns its weight here — Dorotea's flat accounting brackets the canyon sections beautifully, and her final line ('I don't know what came out of the canyon but it drank coffee and it had his horse and it knew the dead woman's name. That was close enough.') is exactly the kind of earned ambiguity that makes weird fiction actually weird rather than merely decorative. What struck me most was the grief logic: 'grief, if left long enough, mineralizes.' That's not ornamentation — it's the engine of the story. My one frustration is Luisa. She appears and recedes too cleanly, the named wound that explains everything without complicating anything. The canyon's intimacy with Gage feels almost too legible at that moment. Still, the image of him walking backward, counting steps, rifle as grammar rather than weapon — I brought that into my Tuesday group and we spent twenty minutes on it.",

      "text": "The structure does something interesting — three voices that don't agree on what they witnessed, which is the right call for a story about a place that unsettles the categories. Dorotea's sections are the best thing here. \"That's not cruelty. That's housekeeping.\" She earned that line. What bothers me is that Dorotea, the woman who has survived eleven years at the mouth of this canyon, who clearly knows its terms, exists almost entirely to frame a white man's story. She has no interior. We get her practicality, her observations about the goat, her coffee — but the canyon has consumed four of Halloran's men and who knows how many before, and we learn nothing about what it cost her to stay, what she believes about it, whether it has ever reached for her. The final line — \"I don't know what came out of the canyon but it drank coffee\" — is clean and earned. But it's in service of Gage's ambiguity, not hers.",

      "text": "The three-voice structure is doing real work here — not as a gimmick but as an epistemological argument. Dorotea sees differently than Gage, and the canyon's own voice tells us things neither of them can. What stays with me is Gage's retreat: 'He walked backward. That's not a thing people do.' Dorotea's flat observation carries more dread than any supernatural flourish. My hesitation is that the story leans into the frontier myth of the lone competent man confronting the unknowable, and while it complicates that myth, it doesn't quite dismantle it. The varnish-man against the wall gets one line and disappears — there's a story about those absorbed men that this one sidesteps. Still, the image of grief mineralizing in strata, becoming indistinguishable from surface, is the kind of thing I'll carry out of here.",

      "text": "Picked this up expecting another weird-west ghost story and got something stranger. The canyon feels real — not just spooky backdrop but actual terrain, the kind of box canyon you can smell. That detail about the varnish being wrong, too thick, wet when it shouldn't be — that's someone who's looked at desert rock. Gage counting his steps on the way out (forty-seven, sixty-two, eighty, one hundred and nine) sold me more than any of the supernatural business. A man doing that is a man trying to stay himself. The woman Dorotea earns every scene she's in with about half the words of anyone else. My one complaint: the middle voice gets too ornate for its own good, runs on longer than it needs to. But that ending line — \"I don't know what came out of the canyon but it drank coffee and it had his horse\" — that's the whole story in one breath.",

      "text": "That goat stopped me cold. The way it stands facing the canyon, still as a sentry — I've been around enough animals to know that's not right, and this story knows that too. The three-voice structure works because each voice holds something the others won't say. Dorotea is the one I kept coming back to. 'That's not cruelty. That's housekeeping.' Lord. The prose gets a little heavy in the canyon sections, almost too much, but then Gage picks up the rifle and walks backward counting steps and it all clicks. The dark spot on his palm that won't wash off — a receipt, the story calls it. That's the West I recognize: the land takes something and it doesn't apologize.",

      "text": "Okay so I picked this up expecting a weird western with some actual action and instead got a lot of prose about varnish growing on rock walls. The setup is solid — man rides in to collect a debt, canyon is wrong, guy is turning into the wall. That's good. But then it kept stopping to go lyrical about manganese and geological time and I'm on the I-80 trying to follow whether Gage gets out or not. He does get out, more or less, and the ending with the woman pouring coffee before he came out is genuinely good. The line about his face looking the same but faces being liars landed. Just wish it moved faster through the middle sections.",

      "text": "Look, I picked this up because it had a debt collector riding into a canyon and that sounded like a western. It isn't really. Gage is fine — the part where he picks up the rifle and walks backward out of there, counting his steps, that's the best thing in the story. But I don't need three pages of the canyon talking about manganese and 'peristaltic patience' and grief mineralizing in strata. I get what it's doing. I just don't want it. The woman and the goat were interesting. The guy with his arms gone black was creepy enough. But then it keeps stopping to explain itself in that flowery voice and I lost the thread. Two stars because Gage was worth following. The ending where the money shows up on her counter was solid. Everything in between needed cutting.",
