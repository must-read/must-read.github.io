  "text": "A fascinating exploration of what we might call the Ship of Theseus problem applied to authorship. Julian replaces Fenwick's final chapters plank by plank -- voice, habits, tea, posture, prose rhythms -- until the question of whose book it really is becomes genuinely unanswerable. The embedded argument that literary imposture is \"the purest expression of what literature does\" is the kind of provocation that works precisely because Julian is both its author and its proof. He is writing criticism of the thing he is doing while he does it, and the recursive quality of that gives the story a philosophical density I found absorbing. The Montaigne quotation -- \"we are all patchwork\" -- does real structural work here rather than serving as ornament. Where I hesitate slightly is the ending: Julian's insistence that he can leave whenever he chooses is clearly meant as dramatic irony, but the story telegraphs that irony rather heavily. I would have preferred more ambiguity about whether Julian might actually be right.",
