  "text": "The institutional machinery here is, frankly, implausible. A man occupies a deceased colleague's cottage for the better part of a year, forges a power of attorney, deposits publishing advances into the dead man's accounts, and the college — which we're told is small enough that \"everyone knows everyone's business\" — simply doesn't notice? The sister's inquiries \"stalled in committee\" is doing a great deal of heavy lifting. That said, the moral territory is genuinely interesting. Julian's conviction that he can step back into his own life whenever he chooses is the story's sharpest observation, and the final mirror scene earns its horror precisely because he doesn't recognise it as horror. The writing is strong. I just wish the world around the narrator were as carefully constructed as the narrator himself.",
