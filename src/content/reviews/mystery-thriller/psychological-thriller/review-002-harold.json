  "text": "Handsomely written, certainly. The prose has a stately, self-regarding quality that suits the narrator's character, and I will concede that the passage about the Montaigne theft — sleeping next to a stolen book rather than hiding it — is genuinely striking. But one does wish something would happen. This is essentially a character study of a man who steals a life, presented in retrospective summary rather than dramatised scene. We are told about the slide from house-sitting to impersonation but rarely shown it in the moment. The final image of Julian practicing expressions in the mirror is effective, though it arrives at a conclusion the reader reached a good twenty pages earlier. Competent literary fiction wearing a thriller's clothing.",
