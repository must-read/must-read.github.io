  "text": "The class dynamics here are the most interesting thing in the story and also the most underexamined. Julian arrives at Whetstone from a town whose \"chief cultural institutions\" are a gas station and a bingo hall, and the narrative knows this is the engine of everything that follows -- the theft, the impersonation, the hollow core. But the story romanticizes the academy Julian infiltrates rather than interrogating it. All those creamy descriptions of Limoges china and linen napkins and leaded glass windows function as seduction for the reader in exactly the way they function as seduction for Julian, and I'm not sure the text is aware of its own complicity in that. The women are also somewhat thinly drawn -- Lena exists primarily to be perceptive about Julian, and Patricia Oakes exists primarily to be fooled by him. They are mirrors for his performance rather than characters with their own interiority. The prose is undeniably accomplished, and the final mirror scene is chilling, but I wanted the story to push harder on what it means that Julian's emptiness is also a form of class violence.",
