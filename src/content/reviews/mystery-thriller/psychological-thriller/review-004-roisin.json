  "text": "OK so this is beautifully written, I'll give it that. The prose is genuinely lovely and there are lines I reread just because they sounded good. But as a thriller? Nothing happens. He steals a dead man's identity and then just... keeps living there. Nobody really comes after him. Lena figures it out and just leaves. The sister writes a letter and it gets buried in committee. I kept waiting for the walls to close in and they never did. The mirror scene at the end is creepy but it's not a payoff, it's a vibe. I wanted consequences. I wanted sweat. What I got was a very pretty meditation on identity that forgot to be tense.",
