  "text": "The prose is accomplished — the Provost's dinner scene, with its cream-and-gold Limoges and candlelight catching the Burgundy, establishes atmosphere with genuine authority. And the central conceit, that Julian's forged chapters are better than the original scholar's work, raises a genuinely interesting question about authorship and authenticity. But the story never quite escapes the gravitational pull of its own cleverness. A narrator writing about literary imposture while committing literary imposture is a hall-of-mirrors effect that flatters the reader's intelligence without demanding much from it. The class aspiration theme — boy from central Pennsylvania enters the academy — is gestured at rather than interrogated. Julian's background is invoked as explanation but never explored as experience. The result is a polished surface that reflects beautifully but lacks the depth it keeps insisting it has.",
