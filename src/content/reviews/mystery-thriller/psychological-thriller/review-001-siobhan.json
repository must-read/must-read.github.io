Julian doesn't decide to steal a dead man's identity in one dramatic moment — he slides into it through dishes in the sink and a cat that needs feeding, and that's exactly how these things happen in real life. The scene where he catches himself telling Fenwick's Dubrovnik anecdote as his own is quietly devastating. I did find the institutional response a bit convenient — no probate filing for eight months, a forged power of attorney going unchallenged — but the internal logic of how a person becomes someone else is rendered with real precision. Lena Brovik reading from that journal is the best scene in the piece.",
