      "text": "The psychological plausibility here is what got me. Julian doesn't decide to steal a dead man's identity in one dramatic moment — he slides into it through dishes in the sink and a cat that needs feeding, and that's exactly how these things happen in real life. The scene where he catches himself telling Fenwick's Dubrovnik anecdote as his own is quietly devastating. I did find the institutional response a bit convenient — no probate filing for eight months, a forged power of attorney going unchallenged — but the internal logic of how a person becomes someone else is rendered with real precision. Lena Brovik reading from that journal is the best scene in the piece.",

      "text": "Handsomely written, certainly. The prose has a stately, self-regarding quality that suits the narrator's character, and I will concede that the passage about the Montaigne theft — sleeping next to a stolen book rather than hiding it — is genuinely striking. But one does wish something would happen. This is essentially a character study of a man who steals a life, presented in retrospective summary rather than dramatised scene. We are told about the slide from house-sitting to impersonation but rarely shown it in the moment. The final image of Julian practicing expressions in the mirror is effective, though it arrives at a conclusion the reader reached a good twenty pages earlier. Competent literary fiction wearing a thriller's clothing.",

      "text": "This is one of the most psychologically precise portraits of identity disturbance I've read in fiction. Julian's self-assessment — \"I have patted down the pockets of my character and they are empty\" — is chilling not because it's dramatic but because it's delivered with such flat clinical honesty. The narrative shows a textbook pattern of identification taken to its pathological extreme: absorbing the tea preference, the handwriting, the posture, the anecdotes, each one arriving \"by a process that was less imitation than absorption.\" What makes it work is that Julian isn't delusional. He knows exactly what he's doing. He simply experiences no internal resistance to it. The moment with the mirror at the end made me set the story down for a minute.",

      "text": "OK so this is beautifully written, I'll give it that. The prose is genuinely lovely and there are lines I reread just because they sounded good. But as a thriller? Nothing happens. He steals a dead man's identity and then just... keeps living there. Nobody really comes after him. Lena figures it out and just leaves. The sister writes a letter and it gets buried in committee. I kept waiting for the walls to close in and they never did. The mirror scene at the end is creepy but it's not a payoff, it's a vibe. I wanted consequences. I wanted sweat. What I got was a very pretty meditation on identity that forgot to be tense.",

      "text": "The prose is accomplished — the Provost's dinner scene, with its cream-and-gold Limoges and candlelight catching the Burgundy, establishes atmosphere with genuine authority. And the central conceit, that Julian's forged chapters are better than the original scholar's work, raises a genuinely interesting question about authorship and authenticity. But the story never quite escapes the gravitational pull of its own cleverness. A narrator writing about literary imposture while committing literary imposture is a hall-of-mirrors effect that flatters the reader's intelligence without demanding much from it. The class aspiration theme — boy from central Pennsylvania enters the academy — is gestured at rather than interrogated. Julian's background is invoked as explanation but never explored as experience. The result is a polished surface that reflects beautifully but lacks the depth it keeps insisting it has.",

      "text": "This is the kind of story that stays with you not because of what happens but because of how it feels to be inside it. Julian's slide from house-sitting into full impersonation is rendered with such patience and such unsettling tenderness that you barely notice the horror of it until it's too late. The moment Patricia Oakes reads his chapters aloud and calls them the best thing Fenwick ever wrote -- \"every word she read was mine, and every compliment she paid was his\" -- is quietly devastating. And the journal passage where Fenwick admits he always saw Julian clearly, always knew what he was, gave me actual chills. What I found most affecting is that the story never asks you to condemn Julian. It simply lets him sit there in the green lamplight, wearing the jacket, feeding the cat, and the absence where his guilt should be becomes its own kind of haunting.",

      "text": "A fascinating exploration of what we might call the Ship of Theseus problem applied to authorship. Julian replaces Fenwick plank by plank -- voice, habits, tea, posture, prose rhythms -- until the question of whose book it really is becomes genuinely unanswerable. The embedded argument that literary imposture is \"the purest expression of what literature does\" works precisely because Julian is both its author and its proof. The recursive quality gives the story a philosophical density I found absorbing. The Montaigne quotation does real structural work rather than serving as ornament. Where I hesitate is the ending: Julian's insistence that he can leave whenever he chooses is clearly dramatic irony, but the story telegraphs it rather heavily. I would have preferred more ambiguity about whether Julian might actually be right.",

      "text": "The institutional machinery here is, frankly, implausible. A man occupies a deceased colleague's cottage for the better part of a year, forges a power of attorney, deposits publishing advances into the dead man's accounts, and the college — which we're told is small enough that \"everyone knows everyone's business\" — simply doesn't notice? The sister's inquiries \"stalled in committee\" is doing a great deal of heavy lifting. That said, the moral territory is genuinely interesting. Julian's conviction that he can step back into his own life whenever he chooses is the story's sharpest observation, and the final mirror scene earns its horror precisely because he doesn't recognise it as horror. The writing is strong. I just wish the world around the narrator were as carefully constructed as the narrator himself.",

      "text": "The class dynamics here are the most interesting thing in the story and also the most underexamined. Julian arrives from a town whose \"chief cultural institutions\" are a gas station and a bingo hall, and the narrative knows this is the engine of everything that follows. But the story romanticizes the academy rather than interrogating it. All those creamy descriptions of Limoges china and leaded glass windows function as seduction for the reader in exactly the way they function for Julian, and I'm not sure the text is aware of its own complicity. The women are thinly drawn -- Lena exists primarily to be perceptive about Julian, Patricia Oakes to be fooled by him. They are mirrors for his performance rather than characters with interiority. The prose is accomplished and the mirror scene is chilling, but I wanted the story to push harder on what it means that Julian's emptiness is also a form of class violence.",
