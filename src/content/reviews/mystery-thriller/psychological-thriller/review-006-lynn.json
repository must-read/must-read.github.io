Julian's slide from house-sitting into full impersonation is rendered with such patience and such unsettling tenderness that you barely notice the horror of it until it's too late. The moment Patricia Oakes reads his chapters aloud and calls them the best thing Fenwick ever wrote -- \"every word she read was mine, and every compliment she paid was his\" -- is quietly devastating. And the journal passage where Fenwick admits he always saw Julian clearly, always knew what he was, gave me actual chills. What I found most affecting is that the story never asks you to condemn Julian. It simply lets him sit there in the green lamplight, wearing the jacket, feeding the cat, and the absence where his guilt should be becomes its own kind of haunting.",
