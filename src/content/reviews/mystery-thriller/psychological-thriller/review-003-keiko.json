  "text": "This is one of the most psychologically precise portraits of identity disturbance I've read in fiction. Julian's self-assessment — \"I have patted down the pockets of my character and they are empty\" — is chilling not because it's dramatic but because it's delivered with such flat clinical honesty. The narrative shows a textbook pattern of identification taken to its pathological extreme: absorbing the tea preference, the handwriting, the posture, the anecdotes, each one arriving \"by a process that was less imitation than absorption.\" What makes it work is that Julian isn't delusional. He knows exactly what he's doing. He simply experiences no internal resistance to it. The moment with the mirror at the end made me set the story down for a minute.",
