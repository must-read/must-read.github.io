      "text": "Competent domestic realism that occasionally rises above its genre. The structural conceit -- a journey south and back, grief as itinerary -- is well-worn territory, and the story knows this, which is both its strength and its limitation. The prose is controlled, sometimes admirably so: the detail of Runa allowing herself to cry for exactly twelve miles before a poorly lit merge ramp is genuinely fine. Where it falters is in the secondary characters. Meg exists primarily as a surface for Runa to react against, and the boy is a symbol before he is a person. The Bengali reading scene does good work, but I wanted the story to resist its own neatness more. The funeral speech felt composed rather than spontaneous -- would a woman this guarded truly confess to a room of strangers?",

      "text": "Runa is one of those rare difficult women in fiction who is allowed to stay difficult. She doesn't soften into likability. She swallows the grenade about the divorce not because she's grown but because she recognizes the shape of her own cruelty, and that distinction matters. The power dynamics between Runa and Meg are rendered with real precision -- the dish-washing scene where they negotiate through cabinet directions rather than actual conversation is quietly masterful.\n\nWhat keeps this from a five for me is the list of Nikhil's friends at the funeral. Each eulogy adds another facet of the son she didn't know, but by the third speaker the pattern becomes visible as a device. I wanted the story to trust me to understand his absence without cataloguing it.",

      "text": "The prose here earns its plainness. \"He drove into a tree, so yes\" is the kind of sentence that does more work than a paragraph of hand-wringing, and Runa's voice holds that same economy throughout. What impresses me most is the discipline of the funeral speech -- she stops herself twice, and each stop reveals more than the words would have. The story understands that grief in immigrant families is never just grief; it's an audit of every compromise. My one reservation is the ending, which tilts slightly toward hope in a way the rest of the story hasn't quite earned. But the image of the kale rotting on the garden path while Runa sits in the dark -- that's real writing.",

      "text": "This is a workshop story. I don't mean that entirely as an insult -- the sentence-level work is better than most. 'She allowed it for twelve miles, and then she stopped, because she was merging onto I-84 and the ramp was poorly lit' is genuinely funny and exact. But the bones of this are a creative writing exercise: difficult immigrant mother, dead son, funeral as crucible, grandchild as bridge. Every beat arrives where you expect it. The Bengali book scene, the mustard fish photo, the eulogy confession -- all good moments individually, all arranged in the most predictable possible order. I wanted this story to swerve somewhere and it never did.",

      "text": "This broke me a little. The moment when Runa sees her son's mustard fish recipe and realizes he learned it from a screen instead of from her hands -- that's the kind of detail that collapses an entire family history into one image. And Kai correcting her Bengali pronunciation while she reads to him? Devastating. The story gets something true about diaspora grandmothers: the way stubbornness and love become indistinguishable, the way saying the true thing can be the cruelest thing. I wish it had pushed further into Runa's interiority during the drive home, which felt slightly rushed compared to the careful accumulation of the middle sections.",

      "text": "The kale on the garden path. It appears in the first paragraph and returns at the end, ruined, uncleaned, and that image holds more grief than any of the explicit funeral scenes. Similarly: the training wheels on the bicycle, which tell Runa something about caution before she enters the house. These are precise, earned images. The prose is controlled throughout. Where it falters is in the middle stretch -- the funeral arrangements, the phone calls from strangers -- which accumulate too neatly into a portrait of the son she didn't know. Each discovery is a little too calibrated to wound. Real absence is messier than a list of revelations.",

      "text": "I have been the woman standing in a kitchen memorizing a phone number from paperwork, telling herself that knowing things is the same as understanding them. This story sees that particular kind of immigrant grandmother with such clarity it made me set the book down for a moment. The ending is right -- not resolved, not hopeful exactly, but open in the way real life is open. She asked. That's all. Whether Meg calls back is beside the point. The boy with Arun's face taking the book without saying goodnight, the training wheels on the bicycle doing what the trooper's call couldn't -- these small observations carry the whole weight.",

      "text": "Competent work. The dialogue carries real weight -- Runa saying 'He drove into a tree, so yes' to the nosy shopkeeper is exactly the kind of blunt deflection a proud woman would use. The funeral speech where she admits she was wrong about the name but says 'it isn't enough, and I know it isn't enough' -- that landed. My issue is the setup. Estranged parent, unexpected death, funeral reconciliation. I've read this arc dozens of times. The cultural specifics are well-handled, the mustard fish detail is good, but the architecture underneath is familiar. It's a well-built house on a plot of land I've walked before.",

      "text": "The scene where Kai corrects Runa's pronunciation of 'hilsha' turned something over in my chest. There's a whole history of cultural transmission in that single correction -- a child who learned what the grandmother failed to teach her own son. And the way the story tracks what Runa doesn't know about Nikhil -- the environmental science job, the volunteer cooking, the beard she'd never seen -- each revelation is a small wound placed with surgical care. The ending is right: not forgiveness, not resolution, just the act of asking. The phone call where Meg says 'I'll ask him' and hangs up is the only honest way this could end. I wanted to stay in that kitchen with Runa, holding the phone, waiting.",
