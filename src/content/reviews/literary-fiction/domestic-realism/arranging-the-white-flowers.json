      "text": "The image of Kavitha sitting on the step beside the cat she was told not to feed — both of them doing nothing about the situation — broke something open in me. The whole story works this way: domestic gestures that seem small until you realize each one is a decision about whether to stay or go. The samosas remade with ground beef is the kind of detail that lodges under your skin. Munro is everywhere in the time-jumps and the plain Ontario landscape, but the Lahiri arrives in the silences between languages, the dal that is never her mother's dal. That final contradictory line held me for a long time.",

      "text": "What I admire most is how the story lets Kavitha's interiority unfold through the things she notices and arranges rather than through stated feeling. The passage about her mother saying 'sometimes' about Neil — that single word containing an entire verdict — is Lahiri at her best, rendered in someone else's prose. The Calcutta visit section earned its brevity. I did want more of the mother as a character in her own right rather than as a mirror for Kavitha's displacement, but perhaps that withholding is the point.",

      "text": "This story understands something specific about immigrant marriages that most fiction gets wrong: Neil is not a bad husband. He is a good husband in the way that a well-built house is a good house — solid, functional, warm enough. The problem is that Kavitha needs something a house cannot provide, and the story is smart enough not to name it, because she cannot name it either. The credit ledger she keeps for him is devastating precisely because it is fair. The flower-arranging as a metaphor for the careful, invisible labor of fitting in is handled without heaviness. I would read an entire novel about this woman.",

      "text": "The Munro influence is the skeleton here — that ability to span years in a paragraph, to make a small Ontario town feel like the entire world. The section where Kavitha describes being accepted 'slowly, politely, with a friendliness that had a bottom to it' is one of those quiet sentences that does more work than a hundred pages of explicit commentary on race and belonging. The cat works as an emotional proxy without being sentimental, which is harder than it looks. The sandesh scene in Calcutta — the dying mother saying things are not as good as they used to be — is a masterful touch. Not sure the bus schedules to Montreal needed to appear twice, but a minor quibble.",

      "text": "I know this woman. Not Kavitha specifically, but the shape of her — the woman who makes things beautiful because it is the one form of presence no one can object to. The pitcher from Neil's mother that is both a gift and a territorial flag. The coat on the third hook. The grapes in the bowl. Every domestic detail is a small archaeology of a marriage. The Calcutta passages have a different texture, warmer and more painful simultaneously, and the story is wise enough to let that difference stand without explaining it. A quiet story that left me sitting with it for a long time afterward.",

      "text": "Structurally, this is a Munro story wearing Lahiri's themes, and the fit is surprisingly natural. The retrospective voice — 'this was the kind of moment Kavitha would remember years later' — is vintage Munro: the narrator stepping outside time to mark the moment that will accrue meaning. The dialogue is restrained in the Lahiri manner, where what matters lives between the lines. The Runaway influence is clearest in the almost-escape passages: the parking-lot moment, the bus schedules to Montreal, the thought that softened into weather. These are precise renderings of a particular kind of female entrapment that Munro mapped better than anyone. The final paradox — 'this was enough. This was not enough.' — risks neatness, as such constructions do, but earns it through the accumulation of domestic evidence preceding it.",

      "text": "Not my usual territory but this one works. The town is real — I mean really real, not the polished version of small-town Ontario that literary fiction usually serves. Betty Macleod making the samosas with ground beef and saying they were just as good is the detail that convinced me this writer knows something. The cat is handled well: not a symbol, not a pet, just a presence. The mother dying in Calcutta while grapes are being washed in Ontario — that juxtaposition does exactly what it should without calling attention to itself.",

      "text": "Competent and emotionally effective but formally conservative. The Munro and Lahiri influences are legible — too legible, perhaps. I can identify the source of every gesture, every structural choice, and that transparency robs the story of some of its power. The flower-arranging conceit is well-deployed but not pushed far enough to become its own thing. The strongest passage is the credit ledger — that single phrase tells us more about this marriage than the rest of the story combined. I wanted the ending to take a harder turn. 'Both of these things were true' is the kind of resolution that comforts rather than disturbs, and this story should disturb.",

      "text": "Look, the prose is clean and the emotional restraint is real, not performed. The cat earns its place. But I've read enough immigrant-domestic-realism to feel the grooves here — the dal that doesn't taste right, the mother dying far away, the husband who tries but doesn't reach. These are true things but they are also expected things, and I want a story that surprises me. The Munro moves — the time-jumps, the small-town precision — are where this piece is most alive. The parking-lot escape fantasy is genuine and earned. I just wish it had followed that impulse somewhere unexpected.",

      "text": "The grape skins beading with water while her mother describes her dying lungs. The cat considering whether she was worth the effort of fear. The tulip petals closed like hands. This is a story that lives in its images, and the images are right. The rhythm of the prose — those long Munro sentences that accumulate clauses like a woman accumulating reasons to stay — suits the content perfectly. I will keep the sandesh passage: the dying mother saying the world has already diminished. That is an image worth returning to.",
