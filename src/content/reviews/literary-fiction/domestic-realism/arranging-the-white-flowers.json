      "text": "That line about the grapes being washed on this side of the world while her mother is dying on the other side \u2014 I had to put my phone down for a moment. This story does something I rarely see done well: it makes domestic routine feel like a language, one Kavitha speaks fluently but was never taught to translate. The cat as emotional mirror works beautifully without ever becoming heavy-handed. The ending holds two contradictions together without resolving them, which is exactly right. I only wish we'd gotten a bit more of Calcutta \u2014 the jasmine courtyard, the pressure cooker at five \u2014 because those brief flashes were the most alive passages in the piece.",

      "text": "The cultural displacement here is rendered with a specificity that earns its weight. Kavitha's samosas being remade with ground beef, the church women calling her Kay, the leftover task at the Christmas concert \u2014 each of these is a small erasure catalogued without self-pity, and the cumulative effect is devastating. The prose has that quality I associate with Lahiri at her best: a controlled surface under which enormous pressure builds. Where it falters slightly is the Ruma phone call, which feels more functional than felt, a plot mechanism rather than a living conversation. But the final image \u2014 the cat that does not leave, the woman who does not touch it \u2014 is the kind of ending that keeps working on you long after the page is turned.",

      "text": "As someone who reads manuscripts about women navigating family structures for a living, I recognize the terrain here \u2014 but the execution is uncommonly good. The interiority is precise without being overwrought. Kavitha's 'credit ledger' for Neil, the way she distinguishes between a right question and the question she needs, the clothes hanging in a Calcutta wardrobe that might not fit anymore \u2014 these details do real psychological work. The story understands that staying is an active verb, not a passive one, and it dramatizes the cost of that labor through accumulation rather than crisis. My one reservation is that Neil remains a sketch \u2014 the coat on the third hook, the grapes, the forehead kiss \u2014 functional rather than fully dimensional. But perhaps that's the point: he is experienced as surfaces because Kavitha has stopped trying to reach what's underneath.",

      "text": "Good prose, disciplined and clean, and the domestic details carry genuine emotional weight \u2014 particularly the bit about Betty Macleod remaking the samosas with ground beef. That's sharp observation. But I kept waiting for the story to push past its own restraint. Kavitha notices, folds things away, stands at windows, drives home. The pattern is the point, I understand that, but after four thousand words of a woman not leaving, not speaking, not touching the cat, the repetition starts to feel less like artistic control and more like a refusal to let the character surprise us. The Calcutta section was too brief. The mother dying with 'quiet competence' \u2014 that's a line that deserved more room.",

      "text": "There is a particular kind of story that understands how women hold contradictions \u2014 not as dramatic conflict but as daily practice, as quietly as arranging flowers on a table. This is one of those stories. I found myself thinking of my own mother, who could communicate an entire worldview through the way she said 'sometimes,' exactly as Kavitha's mother does about Neil. The image of the dal that never tastes quite right because something is different \u2014 the lentils, the water, or the hands \u2014 is worth the whole piece. If I have a complaint, it is that at four thousand words the story felt slightly compressed; the Calcutta visit, in particular, deserved the room to breathe that the Ontario sections are given. But the final scene on the step with the cat is luminous. Both enough and not enough, held together without resolution. That takes real skill.",

      "text": "The Munro inheritance is handled with considerable skill here. The section where Kavitha drives to the florist in Exeter and considers simply not turning back \u2014 'the point was the motion, the not-being-in-the-place-where-she-was' \u2014 manages to compress the entire architecture of Runaway into a single paragraph without announcing itself. The Lahiri thread is equally assured: the dal that is never quite right because 'the lentils here were different, or the water was different, or her hands were different' carries real weight. Where I would press the author is on the cat. As emotional proxy it does its work, but the final scene on the step edges toward a neatness the rest of the story wisely avoids. That closing paradox \u2014 'This was enough. This was not enough' \u2014 states what the preceding forty pages have already demonstrated. Trust the reader, I want to say. Still, the prose throughout is disciplined and exact, and the handling of time \u2014 nineteen years of marriage collapsed into grapes and a third hook \u2014 is genuinely accomplished.",

      "text": "The Ontario small-town detail is sharp. Betty Macleod making the samosas with ground beef and calling them just as good \u2014 that landed. Kavitha's way of noticing the small adjustments the world makes around her presence, folding them into interior silence, felt honest. The Calcutta sections are brief but the pressure cooker at five in the afternoon, the jasmine \u2014 those are real. I'd have liked more of India, more texture there. The marriage works because it doesn't try to be dramatic. Neil's hand on her knee, the cleaned house, the forehead kiss \u2014 all of it accurate and insufficient, and the story knows it.",

      "text": "Structurally this is competent domestic realism operating within well-established conventions. The section breaks function as temporal compression \u2014 effective but not novel. The prose is controlled, occasionally excellent: 'a lie that becomes true if you say it firmly enough' is precise. But the cat as symbolic apparatus is doing work the story should be doing through Kavitha's consciousness alone. And there is a softness in the final paragraphs that the earlier sections \u2014 particularly the devastating passage about flower-arranging as 'being present without being presumptuous' \u2014 had earned the right to avoid. The Munro-Lahiri blend is legible but also somewhat predictable; one knows where each influence begins and ends. I wanted the seams to be stranger.",

      "text": "Fine. It's fine. The prose is clean, the marriage is rendered without sentimentality, and the bit about the samosas with ground beef is genuinely funny in the way only real cruelty is. But I've read this story before \u2014 the quiet immigrant woman, the insufficient husband, the dying mother across the ocean. The cat bothered me. It's doing that Munro thing where the animal carries everything the protagonist won't say, but here it felt like a workshop move, the kind of symbol that arrives pre-loaded. The moment where Diane asks 'Are you all right, Kay?' and Kavitha says 'I'm fine' \u2014 that's the best scene in the piece, because it's the one where craft disappears and something true comes through.",

The cat cleaning its face with one paw \u2014 'a gesture so precise and self-contained that she felt something loosen in her chest.' These images carry the story. I read the final paragraph three times. The holding of contradictions 'with her hands in her lap and her face composed' \u2014 that composure is the most violent thing in this piece.",
