    <h1>About Must Read</h1>

    <p>Must Read is what Goodreads would be if it contained the books themselves — a curated, browsable, searchable library of original short-form literature you can read right here in the browser or pipe to your favorite TTS app.</p>

    <p>Every piece is a 10-25 minute read spanning every major genre and subgenre of popular fiction and creative nonfiction.</p>

    <h2>The Combination Formula</h2>

    <p>Each work on Must Read is defined by a unique 4-element combination: the styles of two authors blended with the structural and thematic DNA of two canonical works from its genre. The formula is documented and visible on every piece.</p>

    <p>This isn't random mixing — each combination is designed for productive tension: a minimalist paired with a maximalist, a literary voice applied to genre conventions, old sensibilities meeting new perspectives.</p>

    <h2>The Readers</h2>

    <p>Every genre has a pool of ~100 reader personas — distinctive fictional readers with consistent tastes, blind spots, and reviewing styles. Their reviews engage with specific elements of the text and reflect genuine taste variation, not uniform praise.</p>

    <h2>How It's Made</h2>

    <p>All works are generated by Claude Opus 4.6. Each piece goes through a multi-stage pipeline: generation from a combination spec, self-review against the style directive, revision, schema validation, quality review, and persona-driven review generation.</p>

    <p>The entire project — every story, every review, every persona — is open source and version-controlled.</p>
