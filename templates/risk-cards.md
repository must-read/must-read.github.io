# Risk Cards

Risk cards are structural constraints assigned to ~30% of works. They force the writer off the safe path and introduce genuine variance in form and approach. When a risk card is assigned, it is MANDATORY — the story must incorporate it as a central architectural element.

## Assignment Rules

- Each work has a 30% probability of receiving a risk card
- Cards are drawn randomly from the pool below
- A card should not be reused within the same generation batch (5 works)
- The card is given to both the planner and writer agents

## Card Pool

### 1. UNRELIABLE NARRATOR
The narrator is lying, mistaken, or self-deceived about a key element of the story. The reader should be able to detect the unreliability through contradictions, gaps, or tonal shifts — but the narrator never acknowledges it directly. The truth emerges through what's NOT said.

### 2. NON-LINEAR TIME
The story is told out of chronological order. The arrangement must create meaning — juxtapositions that reveal irony, echo, or causation invisible in linear sequence. Not just "starts at the end" — genuinely fragmented.

### 3. STORY-AS-DOCUMENT
The story takes the form of a non-literary document: a letter, report, transcript, recipe, manual, inventory, field notes, FAQ, obituary, instruction set, or other found form. The genre of the document should create productive friction with the emotional content.

### 4. AMBIGUOUS ENDING
The story ends without resolving its central tension. Two (or more) interpretations must be equally supported by the text. The ambiguity should not feel like laziness — it should feel like the truest possible ending, where certainty would be a lie.

### 5. SECOND PERSON
The story is told in second person ("you"). The "you" must be specific and earned — not a gimmick. Consider: is the narrator addressing a specific person? Is the reader being implicated? Is the "you" a distancing mechanism for trauma?

### 6. WITHHELD INFORMATION
A key piece of information the reader expects — the reason for the central conflict, the identity of a character, the outcome of a pivotal event — is deliberately never provided. The absence must be felt as a presence. The story is shaped by the hole.

### 7. MULTIPLE VOICES
The story uses 2-3 distinct narrators whose accounts may overlap, contradict, or illuminate each other. Each voice must be formally distinguishable (diction, syntax, focus). The truth lives in the gaps between their versions.

### 8. REVERSE CHRONOLOGY
The story moves backward in time — each scene occurs before the previous one. The effect should be that the reader gains understanding of causes only after experiencing consequences. The emotional arc runs counter to the chronological arc.

### 9. GENRE SUBVERSION
The story sets up the conventions of its assigned genre and then deliberately breaks them. A horror story where the "monster" is benign. A romance where the couple should NOT get together. A mystery where the detective realizes the crime doesn't matter. The subversion must illuminate something true about the genre's assumptions.

### 10. THE PROTAGONIST IS WRONG
The main character's worldview, goal, or moral framework is fundamentally flawed — and the story reveals this not through a tidy epiphany but through consequences that the character may or may not fully understand. The reader sees what the character cannot.

### 11. CONSTRAINT OF SPACE
The entire story takes place in a single room, vehicle, or confined space. All tension, character development, and plot must emerge from what happens within that boundary. The space itself becomes a character.

### 12. DUAL TIMELINE
Two timelines run in parallel — present and past, or two different presents. The timelines must speak to each other through echo, contrast, or causation. The connection between them is the story's real subject.
