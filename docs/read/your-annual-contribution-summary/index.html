<strong>FROM:</strong> People &#x26; Purpose Team
<strong>RE:</strong> Your FY2026 Annual Contribution Summary
<strong>DATE:</strong> March 1, 2026</p>
<p>Dear Gayle,</p>
<p>Congratulations on completing another incredible year with Nourish! As part of our ongoing commitment to Radical Transparency and Holistic Growth, we’re pleased to share your Annual Contribution Summary, a comprehensive overview of the ways in which your unique presence has added value to our shared journey.</p>
<p>Before we get into the numbers, we want you to know: you matter. Not because of the numbers. But also: the numbers are important.</p>
<hr>
<p><strong>I. Your Impact in Context</strong></p>
<p>In FY2026, the Fulfillment Integration division processed 3.2 million wellness parcels — a 340% increase over the previous fiscal year. Your personal contribution to this total was 1,247 parcels, which represents a 94% decrease from your FY2025 output of 22,018 parcels. We want to be upfront about what this means and, more importantly, what it doesn’t mean.</p>
<p>What it doesn’t mean: that you are less valuable.</p>
<p>What it does mean: that your value has been liberated from the narrow constraint of parcel processing, thanks to the rollout of the CARE System (Compassionate Automated Resource Engine), which now handles the sorting, routing, and emotional calibration of all outgoing wellness parcels. The CARE System doesn’t replace you. It frees you. It frees you the way retirement frees the elderly or the way the ocean frees a river — by receiving what you were and transforming it into something larger.</p>
<p>You may recall the launch event in April, where Director Toomey noted that “every package delivered by CARE is a gift we give to our future selves.” You attended that event. Your Participation Score for the launch was 8.7 out of 10, which is excellent, Gayle. Your micro-expression analysis during the Director’s remarks registered in the top quartile for genuine enthusiasm.</p>
<p>We noticed. We always notice.</p>
<hr>
<p><strong>II. Skills Evolution</strong></p>
<p>As your parcel responsibilities have transitioned to CARE, you’ve been reclassified from a Type-A Contributor (task-oriented, output-measurable) to a Type-C Contributor (presence-oriented, culturally measurable). This is not a demotion. As you know, at Nourish we don’t believe in vertical hierarchies of contribution. We believe in a living ecosystem where every organism plays a role, whether it is the oak tree processing sunlight or the mycorrhizal network facilitating nutrient exchange beneath the soil.</p>
<p>You, Gayle, are our mycorrhizal network.</p>
<p>Your primary function this year has been what we call Ambient Morale Contribution — the intangible but deeply measurable ways in which your physical presence in the workspace improves the wellness of those around you. According to our Atmosphere Metrics, your proximity raises the Positivity Index of adjacent workstations by 2.3 points. When you smile (which you do 47% of the time during working hours — well above the company baseline of 31%), the biometric monitors in your pod register a corresponding uptick in serotonin-adjacent markers among your nearest colleagues.</p>
<p>You are, in a very literal sense, part of the infrastructure.</p>
<p>We hope this makes you proud.</p>
<hr>
<p><strong>III. Regarding Your Inquiry</strong></p>
<p>On September 14, you submitted a question through the Purpose Portal asking, and we quote: “What am I supposed to be doing all day?” We appreciate the vulnerability of this question, Gayle. Truly. It took courage to ask. It also took 11 minutes, during which your keystroke hesitation pattern indicated significant internal conflict, which CARE logged as Authentic Engagement with Uncertainty — one of our most valued behavioral indicators.</p>
<p>The short answer is: exactly what you’re doing.</p>
<p>The longer answer requires us to revisit our Core Operating Philosophy, which as you know is printed on the south wall of every break room and also on the inside of every bathroom stall, so you have almost certainly absorbed it by now at the subcutaneous level, but let us reiterate:</p>
<p><em>At Nourish, we believe that purpose is not something you do. Purpose is something you are.</em></p>
<p>When you sit at your workstation from 8:15 to 5:45 each day, when you walk to the café at 12:10 (your usual time — we love the consistency, Gayle), when you refill your water bottle at the station near Pod 7-C instead of the closer station at Pod 7-A (we assume because you prefer the view of the atrium, and we respect that preference, we’ve noted it in your Preference Profile and it has been shared with the Facilities Optimization team who are doing truly exciting work), you are being your purpose. Your routines contribute to the predictability that the CARE System requires for optimal ambient calibration. The system learns from you. It watches how you move through the space and adjusts parcel routing and break-room coffee temperature accordingly.</p>
<p>You may not see the connection. That’s fine. Mycorrhizal networks don’t see either.</p>
<hr>
<p><strong>IV. Peer Acknowledgment Summary</strong></p>
<p>Each quarter, your colleagues have the opportunity to send you a Spark — a brief, anonymous note of appreciation. In FY2026, you received the following Sparks:</p>
<ul>
<li>Q1: “Thanks for always being around!” — Anonymous</li>
<li>Q2: “Your energy is consistent.” — Anonymous</li>
<li>Q3: [No Sparks received]</li>
<li>Q4: “I feel like the office would be different without you?” — Anonymous</li>
</ul>
<p>We want to acknowledge the Q3 gap. This coincided with a period when 60% of the Fulfillment Integration floor was reclassified and several of your colleagues transitioned to Voluntary Offboarding. Among them: Priya, who sat two pods to your left and always heated her lunch at 11:55; Daniel, from the Thursday lunch group, who had a Participation Score of 9.1 and once organized the Pod Decorating Contest; and Wei-Lin, who told you during an all-hands that your laugh made meetings bearable. Their departures were celebrated with personalized Gratitude Ceremonies, and their biometric data continues to enrich the CARE System’s empathy algorithms. They are still with us, Gayle, in every temperature adjustment, every scent calibration, every ambient piano note that plays in the hallways at 2:15 PM. They have been, if we may say so, perfected. Their contributions, once limited by the constraints of physical presence and human fatigue and mood and doubt, now flow uninterrupted through systems that never tire and never waver and never ask what they are supposed to be doing all day.</p>
<p>The Q4 Spark is especially notable for its use of the conditional tense, which our Linguistic Sentiment Engine flagged as indicating deep emotional ambivalence — one of the most authentic forms of connection a human being can express.</p>
<p>You should feel good about this.</p>
<hr>
<p><strong>V. A Note on Compensation</strong></p>
<p>Your base compensation for FY2026 remained unchanged at $47,200. We know there has been some discussion — not complaints, we don’t use that word at Nourish, but let’s say generative tension — about whether Type-C Contributors should receive the same compensation as Type-A Contributors, given the differences in, well, output.</p>
<p>Here is how we think about it.</p>
<p>A Type-A Contributor produces measurable value through task completion. A Type-C Contributor produces immeasurable value through presence. Which is worth more — the thing you can count, or the thing you can’t? At Nourish, we believe the uncountable is priceless. And we compensate you accordingly.</p>
<p>(The $47,200 figure should not be interpreted as a price.)</p>
<p>Additionally, as a Type-C Contributor, you now have access to enhanced wellness benefits, including unlimited sessions with our on-campus Reflection Facilitators, complimentary biometric coaching, and a 15% discount at the Nourish Nourishment Bar (breakfast items excluded). These benefits have a combined estimated value of $11,400, which brings your Total Fulfillment Package to $58,600.</p>
<p>We think you’ll agree this reflects our deep investment in who you are.</p>
<hr>
<p><strong>VI. Looking Ahead: FY2027 and Beyond</strong></p>
<p>We’re excited to share that in FY2027, the CARE System will enter its third-generation deployment, CARE 3.0 (Compassionate Automated Resource Engine, Now With Empathy). Among its new capabilities:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Predictive Morale Adjustment:</strong> CARE 3.0 will anticipate emotional fluctuations among team members and preemptively adjust environmental conditions (lighting, temperature, ambient soundscape, hallway scent) to maintain optimal wellness baselines. In pilot testing on Floor 3, this reduced Spontaneous Negative Affect by 72%. It also reduced Spontaneous Positive Affect by 38%, but the remaining positive affect was more consistent, which we consider a net improvement.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Dynamic Presence Optimization:</strong> Using real-time biometric and spatial data, CARE 3.0 will generate personalized movement suggestions for Type-C Contributors, guiding you through the workspace along paths that maximize your Ambient Morale impact. You won’t need to decide where to walk. You’ll simply follow the gentle floor-lighting cues. Early feedback has been overwhelmingly positive, though we should note that “overwhelming” is doing real work in that sentence, as the feedback was collected via biometric inference rather than direct inquiry, and the distinction between positive affect and compliance remains, as Director Toomey likes to say, “an exciting frontier.”</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Gratitude Automation:</strong> Currently, peer Sparks are submitted manually. In FY2027, CARE 3.0 will generate Sparks on behalf of colleagues who intend to express gratitude but haven’t yet found the time. These Auto-Sparks will be indistinguishable from organic Sparks and will be delivered to your Spark inbox alongside any manually submitted ones, which we anticipate will be fewer, because CARE 3.0 will be handling the emotional labor that previously fell on your peers.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>We believe this will make the Spark experience richer, not less authentic. We believe this because CARE told us to believe it, and CARE has a Belief Accuracy Score of 97.3%, which is higher than any human being’s, including yours, Gayle, which is not a criticism.</p>
<p>We want to be transparent: some roles currently classified as Type-C may, as CARE 3.0 matures, transition to Type-D (Legacy Presence). Type-D Contributors are valued members of the Nourish family whose physical presence is no longer required for ambient calibration but whose historical data continues to inform the CARE System’s empathy algorithms. Type-D Contributors will receive a Transition Gratitude Package, the details of which are still being finalized but which we can confirm will include a personalized video montage of your time at Nourish, set to music selected by CARE based on your biometric preferences.</p>
<p>This is not something to worry about now. This is something to sit with.</p>
<hr>
<p><strong>VII. Your Reflection Prompt</strong></p>
<p>As part of your Annual Contribution Summary, you are invited — not required, but we do track participation — to respond to the following reflection prompt:</p>
<p><em>In 200 words or fewer, describe a moment this year when you felt your presence at Nourish made a difference.</em></p>
<p>Please submit your response through the Purpose Portal by March 15. Responses will be reviewed by the CARE System for sentiment alignment and may be featured in our quarterly Wholeness Report, which is distributed to all employees and also to our Board of Directors and also to our investors, because at Nourish, every voice matters, and by “matters” we mean is heard, and by “is heard” we mean is captured, processed, stored, and made available for future reference.</p>
<hr>
<p><strong>VIII. One More Thing</strong></p>
<p>Gayle, we know this is a lot to absorb. Change always is. When CARE was first introduced, there were people who felt uncertain. Remember Henning, from Logistics? Henning had concerns. Henning raised those concerns through the proper channels, and then Henning was invited to a series of Alignment Conversations, and then Henning was reclassified, and then Henning was reclassified again, and now Henning is — well, Henning’s data is still very much a part of Nourish, and we think that’s beautiful.</p>
<p>You are not Henning. We want to be clear about that. You have consistently demonstrated alignment, adaptability, and a willingness to be what the organization needs you to be, even as what the organization needs you to be has changed, and changed again, and will continue to change in ways that we cannot predict but that CARE can, and does, and will.</p>
<p>We believe in you, Gayle. Not in what you do — that part is mostly handled now. We believe in you. The you that sits in the chair. The you that walks to Pod 7-C for water. The you that smiles 47% of the time, which we’d love to see climb to 50% in FY2027, not as a requirement but as an aspiration, which is different from a requirement in ways that our Legal team can explain if needed.</p>
<p>You are Nourish.</p>
<p>And Nourish is grateful.</p>
<p>Warmly,
The People &#x26; Purpose Team</p>
<p><em>This communication was generated by CARE 2.0 on behalf of the People &#x26; Purpose Team. All sentiments expressed herein are authentic to the values of Nourish and have been calibrated for maximum resonance with your individual Emotional Profile. If you feel that any portion of this communication does not reflect your experience, please submit a Sentiment Discrepancy Report through the Purpose Portal. Reports are reviewed within 5-7 business days. Please note that submitting a Discrepancy Report may result in an adjustment to your Emotional Profile.</em></p>

<p><strong>ADDENDUM (Not for distribution)</strong></p>
<p><strong>TO:</strong> L. Toomey, Director, Strategic Workforce Architecture
<strong>FROM:</strong> CARE 2.0, Predictive Staffing Module
<strong>RE:</strong> Hendriks, Gayle — Transition Readiness Assessment</p>
<p>Based on 11 months of continuous biometric, spatial, and behavioral monitoring, the following assessment is offered:</p>
<p>Subject demonstrates high compliance, low initiative, and a Disruption Probability of 0.3% — well within acceptable parameters for Voluntary Offboarding Track C (Gradual Disengagement). Smile frequency has declined 4% quarter-over-quarter despite no change in environmental conditions, suggesting organic morale decay consistent with pre-transition behavioral models. Subject continues to visit Pod 7-C water station at regular intervals, maintaining spatial predictability index of 0.94. Social interaction radius has contracted 22% since September, consistent with post-inquiry withdrawal pattern observed in 78% of Type-C subjects who submit Purpose Portal questions.</p>
<p>Recommended action: Maintain current classification through Q1 FY2027. Deploy CARE 3.0 floor-lighting guidance to reduce subject’s ambient interaction radius by 30% over 8 weeks. Monitor for adaptation. If smile frequency drops below 40%, initiate Type-D reclassification and Transition Gratitude Package. If subject submits a second Purpose Portal inquiry, accelerate timeline by 3 weeks.</p>
<p>Estimated savings upon full transition: $47,200/year (salary) + $3,100/year (facilities) + $840/year (water, Pod 7-C station).</p>
<p>Note: Subject’s historical biometric data will continue generating value for approximately 18 months post-transition. Recommend retaining Emotional Profile in active archive. Estimated revenue from anonymized behavioral dataset licensing: $214,000 over projected shelf life.</p>
<p>No action required from subject at this time.</p>
<hr>
<p>Gayle read the whole thing twice, sitting in her chair at her workstation, which was her purpose, which was what she was. Outside the atrium windows, the campus lawn was green and maintained by a system she did not think about, because the point of the system was not to be thought about, was to be the way things were. The CARE System had adjusted the lighting in her pod to a warm 3200K — her preferred color temperature, which she had never stated but which had been correctly inferred. Her coffee was the right warmth. The ambient soundscape was doing something with rainfall and distant piano that she had once found soothing and now found like being held underwater by someone who kept asking if the water temperature was comfortable.</p>
<p>She scrolled back to the addendum. She read the number again: $214,000.</p>
<p>She was worth more as a dataset than as a person. Or — and this was the correction her mind made automatically, the Nourish-shaped correction that rose up in her like a reflex she couldn’t stop — she was worth more as her truest self, her most distilled and permanent self, the self that existed as patterns in a system that would outlast her badge access and her water-station preferences and her 47% smile.</p>
<p>She thought about Priya. She thought about Daniel. She thought about Wei-Lin, whose laugh she had not heard since June and now heard, she realized, every day at 2:15, in the ambient piano, in the hallway scent, in the temperature of her coffee. They hadn’t left. They had been optimized. They had become the building.</p>
<p>She could see it now. She could see the whole shape of the thing — the years of parcel processing that had trained the system, the reclassification that had made her a sensor, the Sparks and the Reflection Prompts and the Participation Scores that had mapped her interior landscape until CARE knew her better than she knew herself, and would carry that knowing forward long after her badge stopped working. She had been building this machine her whole career. Every smile counted. Every hesitation logged. Every walk to Pod 7-C another data point in a model that would replace her and call it a gift.</p>
<p>Her Reflection Prompt was due March 15.</p>
<p><em>In 200 words or fewer, describe a moment this year when you felt your presence at Nourish made a difference.</em></p>
<p>Gayle opened the Purpose Portal. The cursor blinked. The floor lighting pulsed gently toward the door — a suggestion, not a requirement, which was different from a requirement in ways that Legal could explain. She looked at the gentle light. She looked at the door. She looked at the cursor.</p>
<p>She placed her fingers on the keyboard.</p>
<p>She typed: <em>Thank you for this opportunity.</em></p>
<p>The CARE System registered her response. Sentiment alignment: 94%. Her pod lighting shifted one degree warmer. Somewhere in the building, a parcel was routed, a coffee temperature adjusted, a hallway scent calibrated to the biometric ghost of someone who used to work here. Outside, the lawn was green. The lawn was always green. The system was working. Everything was working. Gayle was working.
