<hr>
<p>Willa Boone was eleven years old the first time she saw a library burn, and the thing she remembered most was the smell. Not smoke exactly, though there was smoke. Something sweeter underneath it, like the ghost of a forest already cut down, the memory of wood remembering it had once been alive. The pages caught in curls of orange and white, and for a moment before they went black the words stood out sharper than they ever had on the shelf. She thought that was strange — that fire could make a sentence more legible in the instant before it made the sentence nothing at all.</p>
<p>Her mother would have said that was a poet’s observation, not a practical one. Her mother had been a practical woman. She had packed their bags the night the Colorado River Compact collapsed and the water wars turned from litigation to something that needed a different word. She had driven them north from Tucson in a pickup truck with two jugs of water and a box of her daughter’s books in the bed, and when the National Guard turned them back at the Utah border she had not cried, had not argued, had simply turned the truck east toward the Climate Refuge Zone outside Gallup, New Mexico, because crying and arguing both required water the body could not spare.</p>
<p>That was 2039. Willa was nine.</p>
<p>By the time she saw the library burn she had been in Camp Dinnebito for two years and had stopped asking when they were going home. Home was a word that had dried up like the river. You could still say it, but it didn’t carry anything anymore.</p>
<hr>
<p><em>INTAKE FORM — CLIMATE REFUGE ZONE 7 (CAMP DINNEBITO)</em>
<em>Processing Date: 11/14/2039</em></p>
<p><em>Evacuee Name: Willa Jean Boone</em>
<em>Age: 9</em>
<em>Prior Residence: Tucson, AZ (uninhabitable — municipal water failure)</em>
<em>Guardian: Sandra Boone (mother)</em>
<em>Skills/Former Occupation of Guardian: Librarian, Pima County Public Library System (closed 2038)</em>
<em>Assigned Block: D-14</em>
<em>Water Ration Class: Standard (2.5 gal/day/person)</em>
<em>Notes: Evacuee arrived with personal effects including approx. 30 lbs. of books. Nonessential materials — flag for Thermal Reclamation if Protocol 9 activated in this zone.</em></p>
<hr>
<p>The camp was a grid of modular housing units stamped out of recycled shipping containers, arranged in blocks of twelve on a flat stretch of scrubland between the highway and what had been, a decade earlier, ranchland. Now it was just ground. The kind of ground that had given up on growing anything and was waiting to be told what it was for.</p>
<p>Twelve thousand people lived there. Most had come from Arizona or Southern California or the parts of Nevada that weren’t Las Vegas. Las Vegas still functioned, because Las Vegas had money and money could still buy water. The people in Camp Dinnebito had not had enough of it.</p>
<p>Willa’s mother worked in the camp’s resource distribution center — the official name for the warehouse where they sorted whatever arrived on the weekly federal supply trucks. Canned food, water purification tablets, batteries, thermal blankets. Sometimes clothing. Never enough of anything, but always precisely cataloged. Sandra Boone had been a librarian and she understood cataloging the way some people understood breathing — it was just what her body did when her mind wasn’t paying attention.</p>
<p>She also understood what was happening when the Bureau of Resource Recovery trucks arrived in January 2041 and the camp administrator, a politely exhausted woman named Diane Whitfield, announced that Protocol 9 was being activated for Zone 7 due to projected heating fuel shortages.</p>
<p>“They’re taking the books,” Sandra told Willa that night. They were sitting on the floor of their container, which Sandra had made as close to a home as sheet metal and federal-issue furniture allowed. She had hung a quilt on one wall. She had arranged Willa’s books on a shelf made from a plank and two cinder blocks. “The grid can’t handle another winter. They need something to burn.”</p>
<p>“Our books?”</p>
<p>“All the books. The supply warehouse, people’s units, the school’s collection. Everything paper.”</p>
<p>Willa looked at the shelf. Thirty-one books. She had counted them so many times the number had become a kind of prayer. Thirty-one worlds you could walk into when the world you were standing in had stopped making sense. She had read each of them at least four times. Some — the ones her mother had read to her when Tucson still had tap water and the elm tree in their yard still made shade — she had read so many times the pages had gone soft as cloth.</p>
<p>“They can’t,” Willa said.</p>
<p>“They can,” her mother said. She said it the way she said everything that was terrible and true — flatly, without decoration, the way you’d read a weather report that called for a storm you couldn’t stop.</p>
<hr>
<p>The collection teams came through Block D on a Tuesday. Two Bureau workers in gray coveralls with a flatbed cart, moving door to door like census takers. They were polite. They had clipboards. One of them, a young man with sunburned arms, told each household that the materials would be “converted to thermal energy for community benefit” and that credit toward next month’s supplemental ration would be automatic.</p>
<p>Sandra handed over twenty-two of the thirty-one books. She kept nine hidden inside the quilt on the wall, sewn into the batting where the fabric folded over.</p>
<p>Willa watched the young man stack their books on the cart beside everyone else’s — paperbacks and hardcovers and children’s picture books and someone’s Bible and what looked like a binder of family recipes — and she thought about how strange it was that none of this felt like an emergency. The man with the clipboard was smiling. Diane Whitfield had sent around a memo calling it “community resource optimization.” The books were going to become heat, and heat was something everyone needed, and when you put it that way it sounded almost generous.</p>
<p>That was the trick of it, Willa would understand later. The burning never announced itself as burning. It arrived as policy, as protocol, as a reasonable response to scarcity. The fire was always downstream of a form someone had filled out.</p>
<hr>
<p><em>Excerpt from sworn testimony of Sandra Boone, recorded 6/12/2043, Congressional Hearing on Climate Refuge Zone Oversight:</em></p>
<p><em>Q: Ms. Boone, you were employed at Camp Dinnebito’s resource center. In your capacity there, did you have occasion to observe the materials collected under Protocol 9?</em></p>
<p><em>A: I did. I processed intake for three of the seven collection rounds.</em></p>
<p><em>Q: And what did those collections include?</em></p>
<p><em>A: Books, mostly. Personal papers. But also — starting in the third round — boxes from the camp’s own administrative archive. Government reports. Environmental impact assessments. Water table data. Climate projections filed with the Bureau of Land Management going back to 2025.</em></p>
<p><em>Q: Government documents were included in the burn materials?</em></p>
<p><em>A: Yes. The official line was that digital copies existed and the paper was redundant. But I checked. I had access to the federal document database through the resource center’s terminal. Most of those reports had no digital copies. Or the digital copies had been removed. The earliest climate models — the ones showing exactly when the aquifers would fail and who knew about it — those were the first ones they burned.</em></p>
<p><em>Q: You’re suggesting the burning was not purely for fuel.</em></p>
<p><em>A: I’m not suggesting anything. I’m telling you what I saw. They burned the receipts.</em></p>
<hr>
<p>The heating station was a repurposed aircraft hangar at the north end of camp, fitted with industrial furnaces that fed steam through pipes running beneath the container blocks. When Protocol 9 was active, Bureau workers fed the furnaces day and night — pallets of books and paper records broken down and shoveled in like coal.</p>
<p>Willa went to watch one evening in February, drawn by the glow. The hangar doors were open and the light from inside was golden, almost warm-looking, and for a disorienting moment she felt something close to comfort. She hated that. The flames moved like something alive, like dancers, and she remembered — with a sharpness that hurt — the way the grass in their backyard in Tucson had looked in the early morning when the sprinklers were still running, each blade bending under the weight of a single drop, trembling with the effort of holding something so precious.</p>
<p>She had been five, maybe six. Standing at the kitchen window while her mother made coffee. The water caught the light and turned briefly into something other than water — scattered jewels, tiny thrown stars. The sound of it. The sound of water being spent on something as absurd and beautiful as grass.</p>
<p>That sound was gone from the world now.</p>
<p>A Bureau worker saw her at the hangar entrance and waved her away. “Restricted area, kid.”</p>
<p>She left. But she came back.</p>
<hr>
<p>She came back because of what she found on the ground outside the hangar the third time: a page, wind-scattered from an unsecured pallet, lying faceup in the dust with the hangar light falling across it like a reading lamp.</p>
<p>It was from a government report. United States Geological Survey, dated 2027. A single page with a chart showing projected water table depletion for the Colorado Plateau under three emissions scenarios. All three lines dove toward zero. The worst-case line hit zero in 2037. The date was circled in red pen — someone’s handwriting, not printed — and next to it, also in red, three words: <em>They already know.</em></p>
<p>Willa took the page back to her container and showed it to her mother. Sandra held it under the battery lantern and read it twice, her face doing something Willa had never seen before — not crying, not anger, something quieter and more dangerous than either.</p>
<p>“Who wrote this?” Willa asked. “The red pen part.”</p>
<p>“Someone at USGS. Someone who saw the numbers.”</p>
<p>“They already know,” Willa read. “Knew what?”</p>
<p>“That the water would run out. When it would run out. That people would have to leave.” Sandra set the page down on the plank shelf, between two of the hidden books. “This was published nine years before we left Tucson. They had nine years of knowing.”</p>
<p>“Then why didn’t they—”</p>
<p>“Because knowing and doing are different countries,” her mother said. “And there’s no road between them that doesn’t cost someone money.”</p>
<hr>
<p><em>Bureau of Resource Recovery — Internal Memorandum</em>
<em>Date: 3/3/2041</em>
<em>Classification: Zone Administrators Only</em></p>
<p><em>RE: Acceleration of Protocol 9 Collection Schedule</em></p>
<p><em>Effective immediately, collection rounds in all active Climate Refuge Zones will shift from monthly to biweekly. Priority materials for the accelerated schedule include:</em></p>
<p><em>1. Remaining personal book holdings (enforcement authority per Executive Order 2041-14)</em>
<em>2. Pre-2035 government environmental and climate documentation (paper only)</em>
<em>3. Historical newspapers and periodicals</em>
<em>4. Academic publications related to climate science, hydrology, and energy policy</em></p>
<p><em>Rationale: Heating demand projections for the remainder of the winter season exceed available wood pellet supply by 340%. Paper reclamation remains the most viable supplemental fuel source.</em></p>
<p><em>Note: Zone administrators should emphasize the community benefit framing in all communications. Compliance rates remain above 90% in zones where the fuel-conversion message is primary. Zones that have experienced organized resistance (see Zone 12 incident report) have uniformly been those where alternative framings gained traction.</em></p>
<p><em>Do not permit alternative framings to gain traction.</em></p>
<hr>
<p>Willa began collecting the loose pages.</p>
<p>She did it the way her mother would have — systematically, without fuss. Every evening after the Bureau workers had gone to eat, she walked the perimeter of the heating station and gathered whatever the wind or carelessness had freed from the burn pallets. Most of what she found was ordinary — torn chapters of novels, water-stained pages of almanacs, a child’s math workbook with the answers filled in pencil. But some of it was the other kind. Government reports. Water assessments. Climate projections with handwritten annotations. Internal memos that had somehow ended up in the same boxes as the books, headed for the same fire.</p>
<p>She kept everything in a box under her bunk, the same box that had carried their books from Tucson. When it got full she started a second, using a ration crate from the warehouse. When the second box got full her mother gave her a look that was half fear and half something else — something that looked, in certain light, like pride.</p>
<p>“You understand what happens if they find these,” Sandra said.</p>
<p>“They’re burning the proof,” Willa said. “Someone should keep it.”</p>
<p>“Keeping proof is not the same as being safe.”</p>
<p>“You kept the books in the quilt.”</p>
<p>Her mother was quiet for a long time. Outside, the wind moved across the scrubland with nothing left to stop it — a sound like the world exhaling.</p>
<p>“I kept the books because I’m a librarian,” Sandra finally said. “It’s what I am. You can take the building away and fire the staff and cut the budget to zero, but the instinct to preserve, to organize, to make sure someone can find what they need — that doesn’t go away because someone signs a protocol.”</p>
<p>She reached into the quilt and pulled out a paperback, its cover creased white at the spine from years of opening. She handed it to Willa.</p>
<p>“Read the part about the woman in the house,” she said. “The part where they come to burn her books and she won’t leave.”</p>
<p>Willa read it that night by lantern light, lying on her bunk with the container walls ticking in the cold. The woman in the book refused to leave her library. She struck a match and burned with them. Willa read the passage three times, and each time the woman’s choice felt less like madness and more like clarity — the decision that some things are worth more than the body that carries them.</p>
<p>She was eleven. She did not yet know what it meant to believe something was worth dying for. But she was beginning to understand what it meant to believe something was worth keeping.</p>
<hr>
<p>In March the camp school closed. The official reason was “structural reallocation of educational resources,” which meant the building was being converted into additional storage for the heating station. The teacher, Anita Reade, who had taught high school science in Flagstaff before the evacuation, was reassigned to water distribution.</p>
<p>Willa found her sitting on an overturned bucket behind the distribution center, staring at the ground.</p>
<p>“Ms. Reade?”</p>
<p>“They took the classroom globe,” Anita said. “For the paper-mache. The globe is paper-mache over a wire frame. They’re going to strip the paper and burn it.” She looked up. “They’re going to burn the whole world. A little paper one, but still.”</p>
<p>Willa sat down next to her and pulled a folded page from her jacket. The USGS report. She had copied the chart from memory onto the back of a ration card — the three lines diving toward zero, the circled date, the red-pen annotation.</p>
<p>“Someone knew,” Willa said. “In 2027. They published a report.”</p>
<p>Anita took the ration card and studied it.</p>
<p>“I taught climate science for fourteen years,” she said. “Everyone knew. That’s the part no one wants the reports to prove — that it wasn’t a secret. It was in the textbooks. We taught it to children. The children understood it. And then they went home and their parents drove them to soccer practice and the knowing just — evaporated. Like water on hot asphalt.” She handed the card back. “Where did you get the original?”</p>
<p>“It blew off a burn pallet.”</p>
<p>“Do you have more?”</p>
<p>“Two boxes.”</p>
<p>Anita looked at Willa for a long time. Not the way adults usually looked at children in Camp Dinnebito — with fatigue, with the half-present kindness of people conserving their emotional water the same way they conserved their drinking water. This was different. This was recognition.</p>
<p>“There’s a root cellar,” Anita said, “under the old ranch house foundation, north side of camp. The Bureau doesn’t know about it.”</p>
<p>She didn’t say what the cellar could be used for. She didn’t have to.</p>
<hr>
<p><em>From the Congressional Record, Session 117-R (continued):</em></p>
<p><em>CHAIR: The committee has received testimony that certain Zone 7 residents engaged in the unauthorized retention of materials designated for thermal reclamation. Can you speak to this?</em></p>
<p><em>WITNESS (Dir. Oates): There were isolated incidents of noncompliance. Standard enforcement protocols were applied.</em></p>
<p><em>CHAIR: “Standard enforcement protocols” — what does that mean in practice?</em></p>
<p><em>WITNESS: Reduction of ration class. Reassignment of housing block. In extreme cases, transfer to a restricted zone.</em></p>
<p><em>CHAIR: And the materials that were retained — were any of them government documents?</em></p>
<p><em>WITNESS: I’m not prepared to speak to the specific content of retained materials.</em></p>
<p><em>CHAIR: Director Oates, I’m not asking what you’re prepared to do. I’m asking what was burned.</em></p>
<p><em>[Silence.]</em></p>
<p><em>CHAIR: Let the record show the witness declined to answer.</em></p>
<hr>
<p>They moved the boxes on a moonless night in April. Willa, her mother, and Anita Reade, each carrying a box across the scrubland to the collapsed ranch house, stepping between tufts of dead brush that crumbled underfoot like old paper. The root cellar was a concrete-lined hole beneath a warped wooden trapdoor. Inside, the air was cool and dry — better conditions for paper than any room in the camp.</p>
<p>They made twelve trips over the following weeks. The collection grew. Loose pages became folders. Folders became an archive. Anita organized them by type — climate reports, water assessments, energy policy memos, internal Bureau communications, fragments of books arranged by what she called “emotional taxonomy,” which meant she shelved a torn chapter of a novel about a family road trip next to a USGS aquifer map because both were about the same thing: the distance between where you are and where the water is.</p>
<p>Willa asked her once why the organizing mattered.</p>
<p>“Because order is memory,” Anita said. “If you just throw the pages in a hole, they’re trash. If you arrange them so someone can find what they need — then they’re a library. And a library is a claim that the future exists.”</p>
<p>She said it matter-of-factly, the way Sandra said terrible things — without ornament. A statement of weather.</p>

<p>The Bureau found the cellar in June.</p>
<p>Someone had talked, or someone had followed them, or the infrared survey drones had picked up heat signatures crossing open ground at night. It didn’t matter how. What mattered was the morning when Willa came back from the distribution center and saw the gray coveralls and the clipboards at the ranch house foundation, and the flatbed cart already loaded with boxes, and Diane Whitfield standing at the edge of the hole with her arms crossed in administrative regret.</p>
<p>Anita Reade was already there, standing between the cart and the cellar entrance, not blocking anything exactly but not moving either.</p>
<p>“Ms. Reade,” Whitfield said, “these materials were designated for thermal reclamation. Retaining them is a violation of Executive Order 2041-14.”</p>
<p>“Some of those materials are government climate assessments with no digital backup,” Anita said. “You’re not burning fuel. You’re burning evidence.”</p>
<p>“I understand your concern. But the heating needs of twelve thousand residents—”</p>
<p>“The heating needs exist because of decisions documented in those reports. You’re burning the proof that this was predicted. That the people who predicted it were ignored by the same government now burning their work for warmth.”</p>
<p>Whitfield’s expression did not change. “The materials will be collected. Your ration class will be reviewed.”</p>
<p>Willa watched from behind a collapsed wall. She was twelve years old and she was learning something that would shape the rest of her life: that there are moments when being right and being powerless are the same thing. That the truth can sit on a page in plain language, documented and filed in the correct order, and someone with a clipboard can still load it on a cart and drive it to a furnace, and the only protest available to you is to remember what it said.</p>
<p>She had not saved the archive. But she had read most of it. She had an eleven-year-old’s memory, not yet cluttered with the compromises and forgettings of adulthood, and she had spent months reading those pages by lantern light. The numbers and the dates and the names were in her now the way her mother’s books were in her — part of her body, carried in the same place she carried the sound of sprinklers and the smell of wet grass and the weight of a book in her hand in the early morning when the light came through the kitchen window in Tucson and the elm tree made shadows on the floor that moved like something breathing.</p>
<p>They burned the archive that afternoon. Willa stood outside the hangar and watched the smoke rise — gray and white, drifting east like a signal no one was looking for. The pages curled and blackened and for a moment, as before, the words stood out sharper than ever, legible in the instant of their destruction.</p>
<p>She read them as they burned. A date. A projection. A name.</p>
<p>She stood there until the last page was ash. Then she walked back to Block D, sat on her bunk, and began to write. On the backs of ration cards, in the margins of her water allotment forms, in the blank spaces of every piece of paper the Bureau hadn’t yet come to collect. She wrote down what she remembered. The dates. The numbers. The names. The three lines diving toward zero and the red-pen annotation: <em>They already know.</em></p>
<p>She wrote it all down because a library is a claim that the future exists.</p>
<p>Outside, the heating station burned. Inside, a girl wrote by lantern light, and the words she put down were warm.</p>

<p><em>Addendum to the Congressional Record, Session 117-R:</em></p>
<p><em>The committee received into evidence 347 pages of handwritten testimony prepared by Willa Boone, then age 14, consisting of reconstructed data from destroyed USGS, BLM, and EPA climate assessments originally published between 2025 and 2034. Independent verification confirmed the reconstructed data to be substantially accurate.</em></p>
<p><em>Ms. Boone’s testimony was entered as Exhibit 14-A and formed the evidentiary basis for the committee’s finding that the Bureau of Resource Recovery had, under the authority of Thermal Reclamation Protocol 9, systematically destroyed federal climate documentation for which no digital copies existed.</em></p>
<p><em>The committee’s final report, issued 9/2043, concluded: “The burning was never solely about fuel.”</em></p>   </section> <div class="reading-footer" data-astro-cid-r24qxsko> <div class="reading-footer__nav" data-astro-cid-r24qxsko> <a href="/work/burn-protocols-for-a-cooling-world/" class="reading-footer__back" data-astro-cid-r24qxsko> <svg width="16" height="16" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" aria-hidden="true" data-astro-cid-r24qxsko><path d="M19 12H5" data-astro-cid-r24qxsko></path><path d="M12 19l-7-7 7-7" data-astro-cid-r24qxsko></path></svg>
