<p>“It was the most beautiful property in all of Decatur County,” she said from the back seat, where she sat with her pocketbook on her lap and her good hat pinned at an angle she believed was flattering but which made her look, her granddaughter Jolene thought, like a woman who had lost an argument with a milliner. “Three stories. Columns out front like a courthouse. Your great-great-grandfather built that house in 1847 and it stood for a hundred and twelve years before the county let it go to ruin.”</p>
<p>“Mama, we are going to Tallahassee,” said Jolene’s father, Dale, who was driving. He said it the way you say something you have already said four times and know you will say again.</p>
<p>“Tallahassee’s not going anywhere,” the grandmother said. “Harwick House is twenty minutes off the highway and I have not seen it since 1974 and I am seventy-eight years old and I would like to see it once more before I die, which could be any day now, though I know that wouldn’t bother some people in this car.”</p>
<p>Jolene’s brother Webb, who was sixteen and had not removed his earbuds since Atlanta, said nothing. Her mother, Darlene, who was in the passenger seat with a Dean Koontz paperback open on her knee, said nothing. Jolene, who was twenty-three and had come on this trip only because her father had asked her privately and with a tone that suggested he might not survive it alone, looked out the window at the south Georgia pines going past like a fence that never ended and said nothing.</p>
<p>The grandmother took the silence as encouragement.</p>
<p>“There was a silver tea service,” she said. “English. Your great-great-grandmother brought it from Charleston. When the family left the house in 1959 it was still inside. Hidden. In a compartment under the staircase.” She leaned forward between the front seats. Her perfume — White Shoulders, applied each morning with the solemnity of a sacrament — filled the car like a weather system. “That tea service is worth money, Dale.”</p>
<p>“Mama, you told me that story when I was twelve and it wasn’t true then.”</p>
<p>“It is true. Your Aunt Peg confirmed it.”</p>
<p>“Aunt Peg is dead.”</p>
<p>“She confirmed it before she died. I’m not saying she confirmed it from beyond the grave, Dale. I have not lost my faculties.”</p>
<p>Dale’s hands tightened on the steering wheel. In the rearview mirror Jolene could see his jaw doing the thing it did when he was managing his mother, a slow lateral grinding that his dentist had been asking about for years. The landscape outside was flat and green and ferociously uninteresting, the kind of south Georgia terrain that looked like God had started to make something and then gotten distracted. Pine plantations in rows so straight they made your eyes ache. A Dollar General. A church with a marquee that read PRAYER IS THE BEST WIRELESS CONNECTION. Another church. A boarded-up gas station with a Confederate flag someone had spray-painted on the plywood, and beneath it, in smaller letters, JOHN 3:16, as though the two sentiments were compatible, which, Jolene supposed, for many people around here they were.</p>
<p>“You can’t just drive up to someone’s property,” Darlene said, not looking up from her book.</p>
<p>“It’s not someone’s property. It’s a ruin. It’s on a county road. There’s nothing there but the house and the old —” The grandmother stopped. Her mouth closed and opened again around a different word. “The outbuildings.”</p>
<p>She said <em>outbuildings</em> the way she always said it — quickly, lightly, the way you step over a crack in the sidewalk. The way you step over a crack in the sidewalk every single day and after a while you forget you’re doing it, but your legs remember.</p>
<p>Jolene knew what the outbuildings were. She had looked up Harwick House on her phone two hours ago, sitting in the back seat while her grandmother talked, and she had found it on a historical register maintained by the county. The entry was brief. It listed the house, the acreage, the date of construction. It listed the name of the builder, Thomas Harwick, who was Jolene’s however-many-greats grandfather and who was, according to the 1850 census, the owner of forty-one enslaved persons. The outbuildings were slave quarters. The grandmother had never, in all the years Jolene had known her, used the word <em>slave</em> in connection with Harwick House. She said <em>outbuildings</em>. She said <em>the old days</em>. She said, once, <em>help</em>, as in, “They had help back then, everybody did,” with a little wave of her hand as though she were brushing a gnat off the family history.</p>
<p>“Take the next exit,” the grandmother said.</p>
<p>“Mama —”</p>
<p>“Dale Raymond Harwick, take the next exit or I will have a spell right here in this car and you can explain to the paramedics why your mother is prostrate on the shoulder of I-10.”</p>
<p>Dale took the exit.</p>
<hr>
<p>The county road was two lanes of cracked asphalt running between walls of pine and scrub oak, the kind of road where the trees pressed in so close the light went greenish and the air came through the vents smelling of resin and standing water and something under that — red clay, the mineral smell of Georgia dirt, which is not just dirt but a color, a stain that gets into your clothes and your car mats and your history and does not wash out.</p>
<p>A red-tailed hawk sat on a fence post and watched the car pass with the expression of something that had been expecting them. Webb took out one earbud, looked around, put it back in. Darlene turned a page of her Koontz novel. The grandmother leaned forward with her hand on the back of Dale’s seat, scanning the tree line with the focused intensity of a woman tracking prey.</p>
<p>They almost missed the house. It was set back from the road behind a screen of chinaberry and wisteria gone feral, the vines so thick on the front columns that the columns looked like they were being swallowed by the earth from the top down. But the grandmother made a sound — a small, sharp intake of breath, like a woman seeing a lover after a long separation, or like a woman recognizing her own face in a photograph she’d forgotten was taken — and Dale pulled onto the shoulder.</p>
<p>It was still three stories. The roof had caved on the left side, and the windows were dark sockets without glass, and the porch sagged like a mouth losing its teeth, but the bones of the house were intact enough that you could see what it had been. White clapboard gone grey. Green shutters gone black. The front door was open, or rather was missing, and through the doorway you could see straight down a central hall to a rectangle of green light at the back where the rear wall had fallen away and the yard had come in. The yard did not look like it had come in recently. It looked like it had been coming in for decades, slowly, a vine at a time, reclaiming the house the way a body reclaims a wound.</p>
<p>“Lord,” the grandmother said softly. “Lord, Lord.”</p>
<p>She got out of the car without waiting for Dale to turn off the engine. She was across the ditch and into the yard with her pocketbook over her arm before Jolene could get her seatbelt undone, moving with the terrible purpose of a woman who has been thinking about something for fifty years and who is not going to let a little thing like structural collapse get between her and what she has decided to remember.</p>
<p>“Grandma!” Jolene called. “Grandma, you can’t just —”</p>
<p>But she was already on the porch. And she was not alone.</p>
<p>A man was sitting on an upturned five-gallon bucket at the far end of the porch, in the shadow where the wisteria was thickest. He was Black, and old — not grandmother-old but a different kind of old, the kind of old where the age has settled into the architecture of the face and become permanent, the cheekbones and jaw emerging as though the flesh were slowly revealing the structure that had been carrying everything all along. He wore a plaid shirt buttoned to the throat despite the heat and work pants stiff with dried mud, and he was holding a machete across his knees — not in a threatening way but in the way of a man who had been using it to cut back the vines and had stopped to rest, or to wait. He looked at the grandmother. He looked past her, at Jolene and Dale and Darlene and Webb getting out of the car with the particular reluctance of people arriving at a place they had not agreed to visit.</p>
<p>“Afternoon,” he said.</p>
<p>The grandmother stopped mid-stride. She had the look of a woman who has walked into her own living room and found a stranger sitting in her chair, except the living room had not been hers for sixty years and the stranger had been here longer than any Harwick had been alive.</p>
<p>“Good afternoon,” she said, with the particular brightness she used for people she wished were somewhere else. “I’m Louise Harwick. My family built this house.”</p>
<p>The man did not stand up. He looked at her the way the hawk had looked at the car — still, patient, with an attention that missed nothing and expected nothing good.</p>
<p>“I know who built this house,” he said.</p>
<p>“Are you — do you work for the county? I was just telling my son, we’re family, we used to —”</p>
<p>“I know what you used to.”</p>
<p>His name, he said, was Ephraim Gaines. He was the caretaker, though that word, he said, wasn’t exactly right — you don’t take care of a thing like this, you watch it, the way you watch a fire, to make sure it doesn’t spread and to make sure it doesn’t go out. He lived a quarter mile back in the woods in a house his grandfather had built with his own hands from timber he cut himself, because his grandfather did not trust a Harwick house and did not intend to live in one. His grandfather’s grandfather had been born on this property. Born was another word that wasn’t right, he said, looking at the grandmother when he said it, but he used it because the right word was one that polite people did not care to hear.</p>
<p>“Born here,” the grandmother repeated. She was smiling her church smile — the one that showed all her teeth and none of her thoughts, the one that could get you through a covered-dish supper or a funeral or a conversation about race in the South, which were, in Jolene’s experience, roughly the same level of ordeal. “Well. Then you know all about the history.”</p>
<p>Ephraim Gaines looked at her for a long time. The machete rested across his knees. Behind him the porch boards were soft with rot and the wisteria had worked its way between the columns and the lintels in a way that was not decorative but parasitic, a slow dismantlement. A jay screamed in the chinaberry tree and the sound bounced off the empty house and came back sounding like something else entirely — older, less like a bird and more like a human voice that had been compressed by time into a single sharp note.</p>
<p>“Ma’am,” he said, “I know history you couldn’t stand to hear.”</p>
<hr>
<p>The grandmother did not hear this, because the grandmother did not hear things that interfered with the story she had been telling herself since childhood. This was her gift and her damnation, this deafness, and it operated with the precision of a surgical instrument, excising from every conversation, every room, every landscape the parts that didn’t fit the picture she carried in her head — the picture of a beautiful house in a beautiful country built by a fine family, a family with taste, a family with silver. She heard <em>caretaker</em>. She heard <em>history</em>. She did not hear the weight beneath Ephraim Gaines’s voice, the specific gravity of a man whose people had been on this ground for two hundred years, not as owners but as owned, and who was sitting on the porch of the house that had held them with a machete on his knees and a patience that was, if you looked at it closely enough, not patience at all but something harder and older and more frightening, something that had been handed down through more generations than the grandmother’s silver tea service story and was considerably more real.</p>
<p>“I wonder if you might let us have a look inside,” the grandmother said. “There’s a compartment under the main staircase. A hidden compartment. Family silver.”</p>
<p>Ephraim Gaines did not move.</p>
<p>“There’s things under this house,” he said. “But they’re not silver.”</p>
<p>Dale, who had come up behind the grandmother with the wary posture of a man approaching a situation he already knows he cannot control, said, “Sir, we don’t mean to trespass. My mother’s got a notion about this place and the quickest way through it is through it, if you understand me.”</p>
<p>“I understand you,” Ephraim said. He stood. He was taller than he’d looked sitting down, and thinner, the kind of thin that is not frailty but reduction, everything unnecessary burned away by decades of sun and work and the particular labor of living your whole life on a piece of land that tried to kill your family and then pretended it hadn’t. “I’ll take you through. I’ll show you what’s under the stairs.” He looked at the grandmother. “I’ll show you all of it.”</p>
<p>Darlene said she’d wait in the car. She said it the way she said most things — quietly, with a little smile that was not quite consent and not quite refusal, the expression of a woman who had married into the Harwick family and had learned that the safest position was the back seat. Webb put both earbuds back in and followed his father toward the porch with the slack-jawed obedience of a teenager who no longer has the energy to resist. Jolene walked behind the grandmother, watching the old woman pick her way through the ruined hall with her pocketbook clutched to her chest, stepping over fallen plaster and rotten floorboards with the fastidious care of someone who believed the house still owed her something, that the wreckage was a temporary condition, a misunderstanding between the property and time.</p>
<p>The hall smelled of mold and creosote and something underneath that Jolene could not name, something sweet and dark that she would later think was the smell of wood that had been soaking up Georgia heat for a hundred and seventy years, absorbing the temperature of every summer, holding it the way a body holds a fever it cannot break. The wallpaper, where it survived, showed a repeating pattern of magnolias, which Jolene found so perfectly Southern Gothic that she almost laughed, except the air in the hallway was not an air you could laugh in. It was thick and close and wrong in a way she felt in her sternum, a vibration, a hum below hearing, as though the house were not empty but full of something that had chosen to be still.</p>
<p>The staircase rose along the left wall, its banister draped in cobwebs so thick they looked structural, as though the spiders were the only thing keeping the stairs upright. Ephraim Gaines led them to the base. He moved through the ruined house the way you move through a room you have been in ten thousand times — without looking, without hesitating, with the ease of someone who knows where every soft board is, where the floor will hold and where it won’t.</p>
<p>There was a panel in the wall beneath the lowest steps, warped and dark with moisture, fitted so closely into the wall that you would not see it unless you knew where to look.</p>
<p>“That’s it,” the grandmother breathed. “That’s the compartment. Aunt Peg said —”</p>
<p>Ephraim pulled the panel away. It came loose easily, as though it had been opened many times before, as though it had been opened so many times that the wood had memorized the motion, the way a jaw memorizes a scream.</p>
<p>Behind it there was no silver.</p>
<p>Behind it there was a space roughly four feet high and six feet deep, and the walls of that space were not finished walls but bare red Georgia clay, and the clay was not smooth but scored with marks that were not random. They were letters. They were names. Dozens of names, cut into the earth with fingernails or sticks or the edge of a spoon or whatever tool a person could get their hands on when they had been shut into a space under a staircase by another person who called himself their owner. Beneath some of the names were dates. Beneath others there were marks that were not letters at all but hash marks, grouped in fives, the way a person counts days when counting is the only act of resistance left to them.</p>
<p>“Jesus,” Dale said.</p>
<p>“No,” said Ephraim Gaines. “Not Jesus. Abram. Lila. Solomon. Ruth. Dorcas. Peter. Names of people your great-great-grandfather Thomas Harwick kept in this hole when they displeased him. A punishment cell. Three feet wide and you could not stand up and there was no light and no air except what came through the cracks in the stairs when someone walked overhead.” He pointed to the hash marks. “Some of them counted the days. Some of them stopped counting.”</p>
<p>Webb had taken out both earbuds. He was standing behind his father with his mouth open and his face the color of the magnolia wallpaper.</p>
<p>The space smelled of clay and darkness and time and something else, something Jolene felt before she understood it — a chill in the August heat, a pressure against her skin like standing in a current of cold water, the feeling of being in a room that was full of people you could not see. The names in the clay seemed to shift in the bad light. She thought of the census record on her phone: <em>forty-one enslaved persons.</em> Numbers on a federal form. And here were the names, not numbers but names, cut into the earth beneath a staircase in a house her grandmother called beautiful.</p>
<p>The grandmother was staring into the compartment. Her church smile was gone. Her face had come apart the way a face comes apart only when the thing holding it together — the story, the arrangement of features that says <em>I know who I am</em> — has been removed all at once, like a tablecloth pulled from under the dishes. In its place was something Jolene had never seen on her grandmother and would not see again: blankness. Stoppage. The look of a machine that has encountered an input it was not built to process.</p>
<p>“That’s not right,” the grandmother said. “That’s not — Aunt Peg said silver.”</p>
<p>“Your Aunt Peg said what your family always said.” Ephraim’s voice was not angry. It was something worse than angry. It was the voice of a man stating facts so old they had passed through anger and come out the other side into a kind of geological calm — not peace, but the stillness of a thing that has been pressed into stone. “My grandmother was born in 1919 in that house in the woods. She could name every person who was kept on this property. She could name their children and their children’s children all the way down to me. She told me when I was seven years old what was under these stairs. And she told me never to fill it in. Never to plaster over it. Never to let anyone cover those names.” He looked at the grandmother the way you look at someone you have been waiting to speak to for a very long time. “‘Let them see it,’ she said. ‘Every time they come back here looking for what they think they lost, you open that wall and let them see what it cost.’”</p>
<p>The grandmother sat down on the ruined staircase. She sat down hard, as though her legs had made the decision without consulting the rest of her, and plaster dust rose around her in a cloud that looked, in the green light from the collapsed rear wall, like something leaving a body. Her pocketbook slid off her lap and she did not pick it up. Her hat was crooked. She did not straighten it.</p>
<p>“I didn’t know,” she said.</p>
<p>But that was a lie, and everyone standing in that hallway knew it was a lie, and the names in the clay knew it, and the house knew it, sagging on its bones, holding the knowledge in its walls the way it had always held it. She had known. She had always known, the way her mother had known, the way Aunt Peg had known, the way every white Harwick back to Thomas himself had known — not in the part of the mind that speaks, but in the part that chooses not to, the part that says <em>outbuildings</em>, that says <em>the old days</em>, that says <em>help</em>, that builds a life on top of a cellar full of names and calls the architecture beautiful and visits once every thirty years to look for silver.</p>
<p>“Your grandmother came here in 1952,” Ephraim said, and his voice had shifted now, grown quieter, the way a voice grows quiet not from gentleness but from the effort of lifting something very heavy and very old. “My grandmother showed her this. Pulled the panel right off and showed her. Your grandmother stood where you’re sitting and she cried, and then she left, and she came back twenty-two years later in 1974 and she brought you, Mrs. Harwick. She brought you here when you were a young woman. And my mother showed you. She showed you these same names.” He paused. “You’ve seen this before.”</p>
<p>The grandmother did not speak. Her mouth opened and closed. Jolene watched the muscles in her grandmother’s face work like fingers trying to grip something that kept sliding away.</p>
<p>“I don’t — I don’t remember it like that,” the grandmother said finally, and her voice was small in a way Jolene had never heard, a voice from which all the volume and certainty had been withdrawn, the way water withdraws before a wave. “I remember the house. I remember it was beautiful.”</p>
<p>“Yes ma’am,” Ephraim said. “That’s what you remember.”</p>
<hr>
<p>They left the way they had come, down the central hall, through the missing front door, across the porch where the wisteria was pulling the columns down. The grandmother walked ahead of all of them with her arms at her sides and her pocketbook hanging from Dale’s hand — Dale had picked it up, because someone had to — and she did not speak and she did not look back at the house and she did not look at Ephraim Gaines, who stood on the porch and watched them go with the machete at his side, still as the fence post, still as the hawk.</p>
<p>In the car the grandmother sat in the back seat and stared straight ahead. She had not fixed her hat. Her hands were in her lap, palms up, like something that had been set down and was waiting to be picked up again. Nobody spoke. Dale started the engine. The tires crunched on the gravel shoulder and the car pulled back onto the county road and the house disappeared behind the chinaberry and the wisteria and the pines.</p>
<p>After three miles the grandmother said, “He was lying.”</p>
<p>Nobody answered.</p>
<p>“Those marks could have been anything. Termites. Water damage. You can’t just —” She stopped. Started again. “The house was beautiful. Aunt Peg said so. Mother said so. There was silver.”</p>
<p>“Mama,” Dale said.</p>
<p>“There was silver and a tea service and the family was respected in this county and I will not —” Her voice broke. Not into tears. Into something drier and harder, a cracking sound, like a branch that has been bending for years and has finally met the weight it cannot hold. She did not finish the sentence. She turned her face to the window and looked at the pines going past in their straight planted rows, and Jolene, watching her in the mirror, saw her grandmother’s lips move — not speaking, not praying, just moving, the way lips move when the mouth is trying to put something back together that the mind has broken apart.</p>
<p>Jolene looked at her phone. The census record was still open. Forty-one names, listed not as names but as numbers — ages, sexes, colors. No identities. Just quantities. A man, 34, Black. A woman, 28, Black. A child, 6, Black. Forty-one entries that corresponded to forty-one human beings who had lived and worked and been punished and had scratched their names into clay so that someone would know they had existed, and above them on the census form, in clear copperplate, the name of the man who owned them: Thomas Harwick.</p>
<p>Her name. Her family. Her blood.</p>
<p>She closed the phone. She opened it again. She looked at the names.</p>
<p>Outside the pines went past like a fence that never ended, and the hawk was gone from the fence post, and the churches were still there with their marquees full of scripture, and the Dollar General was still there, and the boarded-up gas station was still there with its flag and its verse, and the South rolled on beneath them, green and flat and beautiful and full of things that had been put underground and covered over and called by other names — <em>outbuildings, the old days, help, heritage, silver</em> — and the road ran straight and the sky was white and Jolene sat in the back seat of her father’s car with her grandmother’s silence filling the space between them like red clay, like something that stains, like something that does not wash out, and she thought of Ephraim Gaines on the porch with his hand on the names, and she understood that she would come back. Not for silver. Not for the house. She would come back because he was right — that was the inheritance, the real one, the one you could not sell or display or brag about at church, the one that just sat in the dark under the stairs and waited for you to come and look at it, and you could drive away and drive away and drive away, and it would still be there, and someone would still be standing on that porch, waiting to show you, and the names in the clay would not fade, and the counting would not stop, and the house would go on collapsing around the one part of it that refused to fall.</p>   </section> <div class="reading-footer" data-astro-cid-r24qxsko> <div class="reading-footer__nav" data-astro-cid-r24qxsko> <a href="/work/kin-to-what-burns/" class="reading-footer__back" data-astro-cid-r24qxsko> <svg width="16" height="16" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" aria-hidden="true" data-astro-cid-r24qxsko><path d="M19 12H5" data-astro-cid-r24qxsko></path><path d="M12 19l-7-7 7-7" data-astro-cid-r24qxsko></path></svg>
