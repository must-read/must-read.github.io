The box contained: a set of mother-of-pearl shirt studs, two Bakelite bangles in butterscotch, a tarnished cigarette case engraved with initials I couldn’t read, a pair of men’s leather gloves still shaped to someone’s hands, and the watch.</p>
<p>It was a woman’s wristwatch. Gold-filled case, seventeen jewels, a Bulova from the mid-1940s based on the font and the case design. The dial was cream-colored with slim Arabic numerals and a subsidiary seconds dial at six o’clock. The crystal was scratched but intact. The hands were stopped at 11:47.</p>
<p>I am a person who notices stopped watches. This is a professional obligation — I run a vintage shop on Ainsworth Street in Crown Heights, a narrow storefront with a pressed-tin ceiling and the kind of afternoon light that makes everything look like it exists inside an old photograph. The shop is called Secondhand, which is a pun so obvious I’m embarrassed by it twice a day, and I sell things that other people have stopped needing: jewelry, barware, clothing, books, small furniture, the beautiful detritus of lives that have concluded or changed direction. My name is Nell Pryor. I am thirty-one years old and I have been in love exactly twice, both times with women, both times disastrously, and I have sublimated the resulting feelings into a retail establishment where I am surrounded by objects that belonged to the dead, which is either a coping mechanism or a metaphor but is absolutely not something I’m going to examine too closely.</p>
<p>The watch would not wind. I tried — gently, the way you have to with vintage mechanicals, a quarter-turn at a time, listening for the tick. Nothing. The crown moved freely but the mainspring refused to engage, which usually means the spring has broken or the click spring has come loose, and in either case the repair costs more than a mid-range Bulova is worth. I put the watch in the display case with a tag that said <em>Bulova, c. 1945, as-is, $35</em> and forgot about it for two weeks.</p>
<p>Then Eleanor walked in.</p>
<hr>
<p>The first thing I noticed was that she was wearing a wool suit in August.</p>
<p>The second thing I noticed was that her hair was set in victory rolls so precise they looked structural, load-bearing, like if you pulled a pin the whole architecture would collapse, and that this was not an affectation because the rest of her — the seamed stockings, the low-heeled oxfords, the leather handbag with the brass clasp — matched. She was not doing a vintage aesthetic. She was not on her way to a swing-dance night. She was a woman in her late twenties dressed entirely in the style of 1945, standing in my doorway at four in the afternoon on a Tuesday, looking at me with an expression I recognized but could not immediately name.</p>
<p>“I think,” she said, and then stopped. Her voice was low and careful, the kind of voice that has been trained not to take up too much space. “I think I’ve made a mistake.”</p>
<p>“We take returns within thirty days,” I said, because I am hilarious when I’m nervous, and I was nervous, because she was beautiful in a way that hit me like a change in altitude — not gradually but all at once, a sudden awareness that the air was different.</p>
<p>She did not laugh. She was looking around the shop with the bewildered focus of someone trying to locate themselves on a map that has been redrawn.</p>
<p>“What year is it?” she said.</p>
<p>I told her.</p>
<p>She sat down on the settee I use for customers trying on shoes — a 1960s reupholstered piece in moss-green velvet — and put her face in her gloved hands and stayed very still for a long time. When she looked up, her eyes were dry. That was the thing about Eleanor that I would come to understand only slowly, the way you understand a landscape by walking through it in different weather: she did not cry when she was upset. She went still. She held herself with a kind of rigid composure that was not calm but its opposite — a desperate, white-knuckled maintenance of control, like someone standing in a room where the floor has just given way and deciding, with tremendous effort, not to look down.</p>
<p>Her name was Eleanor Hartley. She was twenty-eight years old, or she had been twenty-eight years old in April of 1945, which meant she was either twenty-eight or a hundred and seven depending on how you counted, and she did not know how she had gotten here. The last thing she remembered was a night in April. A party. The end of the war in Europe had been announced — not yet official, not yet signed, but the word had spread through Brooklyn like a fever, and people had poured into the streets, and Eleanor had been at a gathering in someone’s apartment in Brooklyn Heights, and there had been music and champagne that was not actually champagne but sparkling wine from the Finger Lakes, and she had been standing on the fire escape at 11:47 PM and then she had been standing on Ainsworth Street in August of 2024 and everything was wrong.</p>
<p>“I left my watch somewhere,” she said. “I remember taking it off. I remember — there was someone.” She stopped. That careful voice again, the precision of someone editing herself in real time. “There was a woman at the party. She asked to see my watch.”</p>
<p>She looked at me. I looked at the display case.</p>
<p>The Bulova was still there. Still stopped at 11:47.</p>
<hr>
<p>Here is the thing about time-displacement that One Last Stop gets right and that I can now confirm from personal experience: it is not the large-scale temporal confusion that wrecks you. Eleanor adjusted to smartphones in three days. She figured out the subway — not the routes, which had barely changed, but the MetroCard, which offended her — in an afternoon. She ate her first everything bagel with the solemnity of a sacrament and then asked for another one immediately, which is the correct response. She watched four hours of the Great British Bake Off in a single sitting on my couch and said, “These people are extraordinarily polite about each other’s failures,” which is the most accurate review of that show ever articulated.</p>
<p>What wrecks you is the small stuff. The absences. She reached for a phone that did not exist — not a cell phone but a rotary phone, her hand moving toward the place on the wall where the phone should be. She looked for the evening paper. She listened for the radiator and heard instead the hum of the forced-air system, and the first time the heat kicked on she stood in the hallway with her hand pressed flat against the vent and said, very quietly, “Where does it come from?”</p>
<p>She had no one. This was the fact we circled for days before she said it plainly, sitting on the floor of the shop after hours with her back against the settee and her stockinged feet tucked under her. Her parents were dead — her father in 1940, her mother the following year. She had a brother who had shipped to the Pacific in ‘44 and come back in ‘46, she assumed, she hoped, but she had not been there to know, and now he was either dead from old age or she had missed his entire life, and either way she could not reach him. She had an apartment on Joralemon Street — had had, once — and a job at the Brooklyn Navy Yard, and a circle of friends who gathered on Saturday nights for cards and whiskey and the careful, coded conversations of women who loved women in an era that offered no name for what they were except <em>invert</em> and <em>deviant</em> and, among themselves, nothing at all, because they did not need a word for something that was simply the shape of their lives.</p>
<p>I could hear it in the way she talked about these women. Not what she said — what she didn’t say. The spaces she left around certain names. The way she described a woman called Peggy who worked in the drafting office and wore her hair short and had hands that were always ink-stained, and the way Eleanor’s voice changed when she said Peggy’s name — not louder but more careful, as though the name were something she was carrying and did not want to drop.</p>
<p>“You loved her,” I said.</p>
<p>Eleanor was quiet. She picked at the hem of her skirt — I had bought her some modern clothes from the thrift store on Nostrand, but she wore them the way a cat wears a collar, with visible resentment, and changed back into her own things every evening.</p>
<p>“It wasn’t a word we used,” she said.</p>
<p>“Which word?”</p>
<p>“Any of them.” She looked at me. In the low light of the shop after hours, with the display cases casting their warm gallery glow and the street outside gone quiet, she looked exactly like what she was: a woman from another century, stranded, terrified, holding herself together with a discipline that was beginning, at the edges, to fray. “I don’t know what the rules are here. In your — in now. I see things on the street that I don’t — two women were holding hands on the subway platform yesterday and no one looked at them, Nell. No one looked.”</p>
<p>“That’s how it is now,” I said. “Not everywhere. Not always safely. But here, mostly, yes.”</p>
<p>“I don’t know what to do with that,” she said.</p>
<p>“You don’t have to do anything with it.”</p>
<p>“You don’t understand. I spent — we all spent — so much of our lives being careful. Every sentence. Every glance. You learn to speak in a kind of code that only the people who need to hear it can decode, and the rest of the world hears nothing, and you tell yourself that the code is enough, that the concealment is just how things are, and then I walk down a street in your Brooklyn and I see two women holding hands in the open air and I think — ” She stopped. Her jaw tightened. That stillness again. “I think of all the years I could have held someone’s hand.”</p>
<p>I didn’t touch her. I wanted to. I sat with my hands in my lap and my heart doing something I wasn’t prepared for, and I let the silence hold what she couldn’t say, and after a while she exhaled and said, “Tell me about the watch.”</p>
<hr>
<p>Here is what I knew about the watch, and here is what I was hiding.</p>
<p>The watch had started ticking.</p>
<p>Not when Eleanor arrived. The morning after. I had come downstairs — I live above the shop, a one-bedroom with sloping floors and a bathtub in the kitchen that I have chosen to find charming — and found Eleanor asleep on the settee where I’d left her the night before, wrapped in a quilt my grandmother made, her victory rolls finally collapsed, her hair loose on the velvet, and the watch in the display case was ticking. The hands had moved. It was no longer 11:47. It read 6:14 AM, which was the correct time.</p>
<p>I did not tell her.</p>
<p>I did not tell her because I was afraid — not of the watch, though a watch that fixes itself is objectively alarming — but of what the watch might mean. If it was connected to her displacement. If winding it, if its running, was somehow winding her back. If I was watching a countdown I didn’t understand, and every tick was a unit of measure I couldn’t read, and at the end of whatever span it was marking, she would be gone.</p>
<p>I know how this sounds. I had known her for one day. People do not develop the kind of desperate, gut-level need to keep someone near them after one day. That is the province of romantic comedies and also, apparently, of whatever was happening to me, because from the first morning I came downstairs and found Eleanor Hartley asleep in my shop with her hair undone and the clock ticking, I understood that I was in serious trouble. The specific kind of trouble where you look at a person and the entire room reorganizes itself around them, like they are the point of gravity and everything else — the display cases, the pressed-tin ceiling, your own plans and intentions and carefully maintained solitude — is just debris in their orbit.</p>
<p>I kept the watch in the back room. I told Eleanor the estate-sale Bulova had sold. She didn’t ask questions. She was busy learning to live in 2024, which is a full-time occupation, and I was busy watching her do it, which was its own kind of education.</p>
<hr>
<p>The community formed the way communities always do: by accident, by proximity, by the fundamental human inability to see someone struggling and not bring them soup.</p>
<p>Joonie from the coffee shop on Rogers noticed Eleanor first — noticed, specifically, that Eleanor ordered coffee by asking for “a cup of coffee, please, black” with the precise diction of someone who has never encountered the concept of oat milk, and that she paid in cash that Joonie later told me included a 1943 steel penny. Joonie did not ask questions. Joonie is from Daegu by way of Flushing and has a policy of radical non-judgment that extends to all matters of personal history, fashion choices, and temporal origin. She simply started making Eleanor’s coffee before Eleanor arrived each morning and refused to charge her, which in Crown Heights is the equivalent of adoption.</p>
<p>Dev, who runs the record shop two doors down from Secondhand, recognized the suit. Dev knows fabric the way I know watches — by touch, by weight, by the way it falls — and he took one look at Eleanor’s jacket and said, “That’s period gabardine, 1940s, and it fits you like it was made for you,” and Eleanor said, “It was made for me, in 1944, by a tailor on Atlantic Avenue,” and Dev did not miss a beat, just nodded and said, “Atlantic’s got a Shake Shack now, just so you know,” and invited her to listen to his new Dinah Washington pressing.</p>
<p>There was also Ruthie, who was seventy-three and lived above the coffee shop and had been in the original Stonewall crowd in ‘69 and who took one look at Eleanor and said, “Honey, you’ve got the look of a woman who just figured out the closet door was open this whole time,” and Eleanor said, with a dignity that made my throat ache, “I believe the closet may not have existed in the way I was told it did,” and Ruthie said, “It never does,” and hugged her.</p>
<p>This is what I mean about found community. Not the grand gestures. Not the declarations. A cup of coffee made before you arrive. A door held open. Someone seeing you — the actual, specific, chronologically impossible you — and deciding that you belong here anyway.</p>
<hr>
<p>Six weeks in, Eleanor kissed me.</p>
<p>Not the other way around. I need you to understand this. I had been so careful. I had maintained what I privately called the Cat Sebastian Protocol, which meant: devastating emotional restraint, significant glances, meaningful pauses, absolutely no physical contact beyond the occasional brush of hands over the cash register. I was dying. I was writing in my journal like a Victorian governess. I described, at length, the way Eleanor’s collarbones looked in the light from the shop window. I am not proud of this but I am not lying about it either.</p>
<p>She kissed me in the back room of the shop, where I kept the watch, on a Thursday evening in September. We had been cataloguing a new shipment — Eleanor had turned out to be an exceptional cataloguer, with an eye for provenance and a handwriting so beautiful it made my database spreadsheet feel like a personal failure — and she was holding a 1930s powder compact up to the light, turning it, and she said, “This belonged to someone who was loved. You can tell by the wear pattern — see, here, where the clasp is smooth? That’s from someone opening it every day. Someone who wanted to look their best for someone.”</p>
<p>“You can’t know that from a wear pattern,” I said, because I am a professional.</p>
<p>“I can,” she said. “The same way I know you’ve been looking at me like that for six weeks and not doing anything about it.”</p>
<p>“Like what?”</p>
<p>“Like I’m something in your shop you’re afraid to touch because it might break.”</p>
<p>“I’m not afraid you’ll break,” I said. This was true. Eleanor was the least breakable person I had ever met. She had lost her entire world and rebuilt herself inside mine with a discipline and a grace that made me feel, frankly, like a mess.</p>
<p>“Then what are you afraid of?” she said.</p>
<p>And because I am, fundamentally, a coward who sells other people’s abandoned belongings for a living and uses irony as a shield and has never once in her life said the simple true thing when a complicated evasion was available, I said: “I’m afraid you’ll go back.”</p>
<p>She put the compact down. She looked at me. And this was the moment — if you have read Fingersmith, you know this moment — when the deception breaks. When the thing that has been hidden under the surface of every interaction rises and becomes visible and you realize that both people have been hiding the same thing, from each other and from themselves, and the revelation is not a betrayal but a relief so immense it feels like falling.</p>
<p>“The watch,” she said. “You kept it.”</p>
<p>“Yes.”</p>
<p>“It’s ticking.”</p>
<p>“Yes.”</p>
<p>“How long?”</p>
<p>“Since the morning after you arrived.”</p>
<p>She looked at me for a long time. In the back room, surrounded by objects from dead people’s houses, with the September light coming through the window and the watch ticking on the shelf behind me, Eleanor Hartley — born 1917, displaced 2024, currently wearing a borrowed flannel shirt over her period slip because it was laundry day — looked at me and said:</p>
<p>“I thought the watch was what brought me here. I’ve been thinking about it every day. Whether it’s counting down. Whether there’s a moment when it stops and I go back.”</p>
<p>“I think about that too.”</p>
<p>“I don’t want to go back, Nell.”</p>
<p>“I know.”</p>
<p>“Not because of — not just because of the oat milk and the holding hands and the — what’s the show with the baking?”</p>
<p>“Bake Off.”</p>
<p>“Not just because of that. Because of you. Because you kept the watch and you didn’t tell me, which means you were afraid of the same thing I was afraid of, which means — ” She stopped. I watched her do the thing she always did: the stillness, the composure, the refusal to let the feeling be larger than the sentence. But this time the sentence wouldn’t hold. Her voice broke on the word <em>means</em> and she said, “Which means this is real.”</p>
<p>“Yeah,” I said. “It’s real.”</p>
<p>She kissed me. Or I kissed her. Or we met somewhere in the space between the powder compact and the shelf where the watch was ticking, and it was not like fireworks or like coming home or like any of the other metaphors that people who have not been kissed by a time-displaced woman from 1945 use to describe kissing. It was like a clock starting. Like a mechanism that has been frozen finally engaging, the spring releasing, the gears beginning to turn. It was like the entire room — the entire shop, the street, the borough, the city — had been holding its breath, and now it exhaled.</p>

<p>That night I brought the watch out and set it on the table between us. We looked at it together. It ticked.</p>
<p>“What if winding it is what keeps me here?” Eleanor said. She touched the crystal with one fingertip. “What if it stops and I stop?”</p>
<p>“I thought the same thing,” I said. “That’s why I hid it.”</p>
<p>“From me, or from yourself?”</p>
<p>“Both.”</p>
<p>She smiled. It was a small smile, the kind that Cat Sebastian writes — not broad, not triumphant, but precise, a smile that knows exactly how much it costs and pays it anyway.</p>
<p>“In 1945,” she said, “I would not have been able to tell you what I wanted. I would have sat in your shop and drunk your coffee and helped you catalogue your beautiful old things and I would have been so grateful and so careful and I would never, ever have told you. I would have carried it like a stone in my chest until I was old or dead or both. That’s what we did. That was the arrangement.”</p>
<p>“And now?”</p>
<p>“Now I’m sitting in your kitchen at midnight and the watch is ticking and I don’t know if I have seventy years or seventy minutes and I refuse — I absolutely refuse — to waste any of it being careful.”</p>
<p>She took my hand across the table. Her grip was firm and warm and entirely present.</p>
<p>“I love you,” she said. “That is not a word I have ever said to a woman out loud before and it is — it is so much easier than I thought it would be. All those years of silence and the word was right there the whole time, easy as breathing, and no one ever let me say it.”</p>
<p>I was crying. Obviously. I am a person who cries at commercials and I was being told <em>I love you</em> by a time-displaced woman in a flannel shirt in my kitchen in Brooklyn at midnight, and if you think I maintained any kind of composure you have dramatically overestimated me.</p>
<p>“I love you too,” I said. “And the watch has been ticking for six weeks and you’re still here and I don’t think it’s counting down. I think it’s counting up.”</p>
<p>She looked at the watch. She looked at me.</p>
<p>“Counting up,” she repeated. “I like that.”</p>
<p>The watch ticked. Outside, a siren went by on Atlantic. The refrigerator hummed. From the apartment next door came the faint sound of someone watching late-night television, a laugh track bleeding through the walls like evidence of other people’s ordinary lives.</p>
<p>“Stay,” I said.</p>
<p>“I’m here,” she said.</p>
<p>The watch kept ticking. It has not stopped.</p>
<hr>
<p>It’s been five months now. Eleanor has a library card and a favorite booth at Joonie’s and a winter coat from the Goodwill on Flatbush that she pronounces “adequate, though the stitching is criminal.” She has learned to text — her texts read like telegrams, all caps, no punctuation, deeply charming — and she has not learned to love the subway, but she tolerates it, which is all anyone can ask of public transit.</p>
<p>The watch sits on our nightstand. Hers and mine. She winds it every morning, a quarter-turn, listening for the tick. It runs two minutes fast, which Eleanor says is a sign of good health in a watch and also, she thinks, in a person. I have not corrected her on this. There are some beliefs that are more useful than accurate.</p>
<p>Ruthie says she’s never seen two people more ridiculous. Dev made us a playlist that starts with Dinah Washington and ends with Chappell Roan, which Eleanor initially found bewildering and now plays on repeat in the shop, singing along with the specific fervor of a woman who has waited seventy-nine years to sing about loving women at full volume.</p>
<p>Sometimes at night she gets quiet. I know what the quiet means now. It means she’s back there — not physically, but in the part of her that remembers a fire escape in Brooklyn Heights and a party where the war was ending and a woman who asked to see her watch, and then a gap, a blank, a severance. The seventy-nine years she didn’t live. The friends who aged and died without her. Peggy with the ink-stained hands, who she loved and never told.</p>
<p>I hold her when it happens. Not because holding fixes anything — it doesn’t, and anyone who says otherwise is selling something — but because presence is the only honest response to grief, and because Eleanor spent a lifetime in a world that required her to grieve alone, and she will not do that again if I have anything to say about it.</p>
<p>The watch ticks.</p>
<p>We are counting up.</p>   </section> <div class="reading-footer" data-astro-cid-r24qxsko> <div class="reading-footer__nav" data-astro-cid-r24qxsko> <a href="/work/the-stopped-clock-at-ainsworth-street/" class="reading-footer__back" data-astro-cid-r24qxsko> <svg width="16" height="16" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" aria-hidden="true" data-astro-cid-r24qxsko><path d="M19 12H5" data-astro-cid-r24qxsko></path><path d="M12 19l-7-7 7-7" data-astro-cid-r24qxsko></path></svg>
