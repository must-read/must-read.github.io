<p>I need you to understand that distinction, because what happened at Priya and Dev’s engagement dinner was not — despite how Priya’s mother later described it to my mother, who described it to me over speakerphone while audibly eating almonds — a “psychological hostage situation.” It was coaching. I was providing Priya with real-time emotional support via a discreet Bluetooth device tucked behind her left ear, and if the evening happened to go sideways, well, that was less about my methods and more about the fundamental unpredictability of restaurant candles.</p>
<p>“He’s about to do the toast,” Priya whispered, pretending to adjust her earring. Through the restaurant window — I was parked across the street in my Civic, laptop open, running what I privately called Mission Control — I could see Dev rising from his chair with the careful gravity of a man who has practiced this moment in the shower.</p>
<p>“Perfect,” I said. “When he mentions the umbrella story, touch his wrist. Not his hand — his wrist. It’s more intimate.”</p>
<p>“Why his wrist?”</p>
<p>“Because the inside of the wrist is where you check for a pulse, Priya. You’re literally reaching for his heartbeat. It’s science.”</p>
<p>It was not science. But it sounded like science, which in matters of love is often more useful.</p>
<p>Dev’s toast was beautiful. He talked about the afternoon they’d gotten caught in the rain outside Powell’s Books and shared a broken umbrella, walking seventeen blocks pressed together because neither of them wanted to be the one to suggest a cab. Priya’s eyes went glassy. I whispered, “Now. The wrist.” She reached across the table. The candle was between them. In reaching, she knocked it. The flame kissed the linen napkin, which went up with a cheerfulness that seemed almost personal, and in the scramble to pat it out with a bread plate, the earpiece tumbled from behind Priya’s ear, bounced once off the table, and landed in Dev’s water glass with a soft, definitive <em>plink</em>.</p>
<p>There was a silence of the kind usually reserved for moments when a doctor enters a waiting room without smiling.</p>
<p>Dev fished the earpiece out. Looked at it. Looked at Priya. Looked at the window across the street, where I was frantically ducking below the dashboard.</p>
<p>“Is that — is someone <em>listening</em> to this?”</p>
<p>Priya said nothing, which was not one of the scripted options.</p>
<p>“Priya,” I said into the dead earpiece. “That wasn’t supposed to be the callback.”</p>
<hr>
<p>Three weeks to the engagement party. Two hundred and forty guests. One furious bride-to-be who had banned me from, and I quote, “coming within fifteen feet of my relationship, my fiance, or any situation in which human emotions are present.” Which left me, professionally speaking, in a tight spot, given that human emotions are famously present at engagement parties and that Priya’s mother, Mrs. Rajan, was my most important client and the reason my events business had survived the post-pandemic extinction event that killed every other solo coordinator in Portland.</p>
<p>I couldn’t let this party fail. The party was the only thread holding the whole thing together — Dev was already staying at his brother’s apartment, and the RSVPs were still coming in from relatives in Hyderabad who had booked flights.</p>
<p>The problem, which Priya informed me of with the icy calm of a woman who has recently set fire to a napkin in a nice restaurant, was that she had hired a professional. A conflict mediator. Someone whose job it was to sit people down and make them talk about their feelings without the aid of Bluetooth devices, hidden playlists, or — a detail Priya brought up with unnecessary specificity — any form of surveillance equipment.</p>
<p>His name was Elliot Yoon, and I hated him on sight.</p>
<p>Not because he was bad-looking. That was actually the problem. He was good-looking in the worst possible way: the quiet, structural way, like a building you don’t notice until someone points out the proportions and then you can’t stop staring at the windows. He had the kind of calm that made you want to throw something at him just to see if he’d flinch. He did not flinch. He sat across from me at the first planning session in Priya’s living room, legs crossed at the ankle, notebook open, pen held loosely — not like a weapon but like a medical instrument — and listened to me explain my vision for the party with an expression of polite, focused horror.</p>
<p>“So,” he said, when I’d finished outlining the curated Spotify playlist that would tell the story of Priya and Dev’s relationship in chronological order, starting with the song that was playing in the coffee shop where they met and ending with their wedding song, which they hadn’t chosen yet but which I had narrowed to three candidates, “you want to pre-script the entire emotional arc of their evening.”</p>
<p>“I want to <em>support</em> it.”</p>
<p>“By choosing what they feel and when they feel it.”</p>
<p>“By creating an environment conducive to authentic emotional expression.”</p>
<p>He wrote something in his notebook. I couldn’t see what. It was probably the word <em>unhinged</em>.</p>
<p>“What would you suggest?” I asked, in the tone of someone who was absolutely not asking.</p>
<p>“I’d ask them what songs matter to them.”</p>
<p>“That’s it?”</p>
<p>“That’s a start.”</p>
<p>“That’s not a start, that’s a surrender. You’re a conflict mediator — don’t you have, I don’t know, techniques? Frameworks?”</p>
<p>“My main technique is listening.” He uncrossed his ankles and crossed them the other way, like a man settling in for a long and patient siege. “Which, I’ve noticed, is not currently on your agenda.”</p>
<p>Here is what I wanted to say: <em>Listening is not a strategy. Listening is what you do when you’ve run out of strategies and you’re hoping the problem solves itself while you sit there looking thoughtful.</em> What I actually said was nothing, because he’d looked up from his notebook and his eyes were brown and direct and held no judgment at all, which was somehow more devastating than if they’d held all of it.</p>
<p>The bet happened because I needed it to. Because sitting in that room watching Elliot Yoon calmly suggest that we “give Priya and Dev space to find their own way back to each other” was like watching someone try to put out a house fire with a glass of water and a soothing tone of voice.</p>
<p>“One week,” I said. “I get one week to try my approach. You get one week to try yours. Whoever makes progress — real, measurable progress — gets full creative control of the party.”</p>
<p>“And if your approach makes things worse?”</p>
<p>“It won’t.”</p>
<p>“But if it does?”</p>
<p>“Then I stop giving unsolicited relationship advice. Permanently.”</p>
<p>He looked at me for a long moment. “Deal.”</p>
<p>His handshake was warm and firm and over too quickly, which I found irritating for reasons I declined to examine.</p>
<hr>
<p>My approach was elegant. My approach was a complete re-creation of Priya and Dev’s first date: the same restaurant on Division Street, the same corner booth, the same accidentally-ordered mushroom risotto that neither of them had actually liked but that they’d eaten anyway because they were too nervous to send it back. I even arranged for rain, by which I mean I checked three weather apps and selected a Tuesday with a seventy percent chance of precipitation. Fate, it turns out, does not take requests. The evening was clear and mild. I bought a garden sprinkler and positioned it near the entrance. It was not my finest hour, but the illusion held for the six seconds between their arrival and Dev’s noticing that the “rain” was falling exclusively on a four-foot radius of sidewalk.</p>
<p>Still. The dinner itself was working. Priya was laughing, really laughing, at the risotto, and Dev was telling the story of how he’d been too nervous to admit he was allergic to mushrooms and had spent their entire first date trying not to visibly swell. They were <em>remembering</em>. They were leaning in. I was monitoring from a bakery across the street — I’d learned my lesson about the car — and I could feel it, that warm tidal pull of two people falling back into the current of each other.</p>
<p>Then the coat check attendant called Dev over to collect a binder someone had left.</p>
<p>The binder was mine. It was labeled, in my handwriting, “OPERATION SECOND FIRST DATE — PRIYA/DEV — FULL RUN OF SHOW.”</p>
<p>I had left it in my coat. My coat was at the coat check. The coat check attendant, a young man whose helpful initiative would in other contexts be admirable, had assumed it belonged to someone at the table and had delivered it with the cheerful efficiency of a grenade courier.</p>
<p>Dev read the first page. His eyes moved from Priya to the mushroom risotto, which now sat between them like evidence in a trial neither of them had asked for.</p>
<p>“The sprinkler,” he said quietly. “The sprinkler was you.”</p>
<p>I watched through the bakery window as he stood, put on his coat, and walked out into the authentically dry evening. Priya sat alone in the booth. She did not look at the window. She didn’t need to. We both knew I was there.</p>
<hr>
<p>This is perhaps the moment to mention that Priya and Dev were not the only couple whose emotional lives I had recently taken under management.</p>
<p>There was also Ravi and Suki, who had been fighting for three weeks about whether to adopt a dog. Ravi wanted one. Suki thought their apartment was too small. I had counseled Ravi — wisely, I believed — that nothing demonstrates commitment and domestic readiness like <em>showing up with the puppy</em>. “Present her with the reality of the love,” I’d told him, “and the logistics will sort themselves out.” This is the kind of sentence that sounds profound at 11 p.m. over wine and absolutely deranged in the sober light of retrospect.</p>
<p>There was also Tomas and Bea, who were stuck in the purgatory of a long-distance relationship with no plan for resolution. Tomas was in Portland; Bea was in Seattle. I had suggested Tomas write a letter — a real letter, on paper, expressing everything he’d been afraid to say about wanting her to move to Portland. Tomas, who had the technological sophistication of a man who still referred to screenshots as “computer photographs,” had somehow typed this letter into the group chat instead of a word processor and hit send.</p>
<p>The letter was five paragraphs long. It included the phrase “I cannot sleep without the geography of you.” It was now screenshotted and circulating among forty-three people, including Bea’s mother and Ravi’s dentist.</p>
<p>These are the facts. I present them without editorializing, except to note that unseen in the background, Fate was quietly slipping lead into the boxing glove, and I — brilliant, capable, relationship-savvy Juliet Fawley — was too busy lacing up my own gloves to notice.</p>
<hr>
<p>Elliot’s week went differently.</p>
<p>He met with Priya and Dev separately. He asked them questions. He listened. He did not recreate anything or engineer spontaneous encounters in controlled environments. He just — sat there, with his notebook and his calm brown eyes and his maddeningly effective silence, and let people talk.</p>
<p>“They’re making progress,” Priya told me, with the particular gentleness people use when they’re trying not to rub something in. “He asked Dev what he actually felt about the earpiece thing, and Dev said he wasn’t angry about the earpiece — he was angry because he thought the whole evening was fake, and he couldn’t tell which parts of Priya were Priya and which parts were me.”</p>
<p>This landed in a place I wasn’t ready for.</p>
<p>“That’s — ” I started.</p>
<p>“He also asked me what I was afraid of,” Priya said. “And I said I was afraid Dev only proposed because things looked perfect from the outside, and I couldn’t keep the outside perfect forever. And Elliot said, ‘What if he proposed because of how things feel on the inside?’ And I cried for forty-five minutes.”</p>
<p>“He made you cry for forty-five minutes?”</p>
<p>“It was a good cry, Juliet.”</p>
<p>At our next planning session — the one where we were supposed to discuss centerpieces and I was supposed to concede defeat with grace — I sat across from Elliot and felt the specific frustration of having spent years perfecting an elaborate system only to watch someone achieve better results by doing almost nothing.</p>
<p>“You just <em>listen</em>,” I said, like it was an accusation.</p>
<p>“You say that like it’s cheating.”</p>
<p>“It is cheating. You’re exploiting people’s natural desire to be heard. It’s — it’s emotional judo. You’re using their own feelings against them.”</p>
<p>“I’m using their feelings <em>for</em> them.” He tilted his head, and the light from Priya’s kitchen window did something to his jaw that I resented. “What do you use?”</p>
<p>“Pinterest boards. Curated playlists. Well-timed grand gestures.”</p>
<p>“And how’s that going?”</p>
<p>“I am currently zero for three, and you are not allowed to enjoy that.”</p>
<p>“I’m not enjoying it.”</p>
<p>“Your mouth is doing a thing.”</p>
<p>“That’s just my mouth.”</p>
<p>“Your mouth is doing a <em>specific</em> thing, and I need it to stop.”</p>
<p>He smiled. Not the polite professional version — the real one, slightly crooked, like a sentence that changes direction halfway through and lands somewhere better.</p>
<p><em>Shut up, Juliet.</em></p>
<hr>
<p>The practice dinner was my last stand.</p>
<p>I had organized it as a dry run for the engagement party — a smaller gathering, our friend group only, a chance to test the flow. What I had actually organized, though I didn’t know it yet, was the most efficient delivery system for social catastrophe since the invention of the group text.</p>
<p>Ravi arrived first, with the puppy. I had told him to bring the puppy as a peace offering to Suki — and also to Priya’s mother, Mrs. Rajan, whose garden the puppy had destroyed the previous week during an unauthorized escape. The puppy, a golden retriever of enormous paws and no impulse control, entered the party like a small joyful tornado.</p>
<p>Tomas arrived second, with a guitar. This was my suggestion. I had told him that what Bea needed was a grand gesture, something public and romantic, a song that would make the whole room cry. What I had not accounted for was that Tomas could not play the guitar. He had purchased it that afternoon.</p>
<p>Bea arrived third, with a real estate agent.</p>
<p>This one requires explanation. Elliot had suggested, in one of his sessions with Bea, that she “explore what putting down roots in Portland might look like.” Bea had mentioned this to me. I had amplified it. The real estate agent — a woman named Donna with the aggressive optimism of someone who works exclusively on commission — had understood her invitation to the “party” as a networking opportunity and had arrived with listing sheets and a laser pointer.</p>
<p>Dev arrived last, alone, hoping to find Priya and have the quiet conversation Elliot had been building toward all week. He had the tentative, hopeful expression of a man approaching a door behind which he believes something good is waiting. What was actually behind the door was: a puppy running through the living room trailing a shredded listing sheet; Tomas in the corner attempting to tune a guitar he did not know how to tune; Donna pitching Mrs. Rajan on a three-bedroom in Sellwood with “excellent natural light”; Ravi chasing the puppy; Suki refusing to chase the puppy on the grounds that it was “not her puppy and never would be”; and me, standing in the middle of it all with the wild-eyed certainty of a general who has just realized that every unit on the battlefield is firing at each other.</p>
<p>Tomas began to play. The sound that emerged was the kind of thing that, if produced in a medieval village, would have prompted a visit from the local exorcist. The puppy, startled, lunged sideways into Tomas’s music stand, which toppled into Donna’s display of listing sheets, which scattered across the floor in a drift of glossy paper that the puppy immediately began to eat.</p>
<p>Donna said, “That property has a home warranty.”</p>
<p>Tomas said, “Bea, this song is for you,” and struck a chord that contained notes from at least three different keys.</p>
<p>Dev looked at the room. Looked at Priya. Said, very quietly: “This is what it’ll always be. Your friends running our relationship.”</p>
<p>Priya looked at me. The room was still going — the puppy, the guitar, Donna explaining escrow — but between us there was a terrible clarity.</p>
<p>“He’s right,” she said.</p>
<hr>
<p>I found the back steps because they were the farthest point from the living room that was still technically at the party. Inside, someone had turned off Tomas’s guitar, which was an act of mercy the Geneva Convention should have covered. The February air was sharp and clean and I sat down on the cold concrete and pressed my palms flat against it because I needed to feel something that was not the inside of my own head.</p>
<p>I heard the door open behind me. Elliot sat down. He didn’t say anything. He just sat on the cold step and looked at the same dark yard and waited.</p>
<p>“I think I might be the reason none of this works,” I said.</p>
<p>He didn’t reassure me. He didn’t argue. He didn’t reach for his notebook. He just stayed there, close enough that I could feel the warmth of his shoulder not quite touching mine.</p>
<p>“They love each other,” I said. “Priya and Dev. They actually love each other, and I keep — ” My throat did something inconvenient. “I keep getting in the way of it. I keep building the set and then wondering why everyone looks like they’re acting.”</p>
<p>Somewhere inside, Tomas was still playing. The puppy barked twice, the second bark trailing off into a whine.</p>
<p>“That’s the first honest thing you’ve said about relationships since I met you,” Elliot said.</p>
<p>“That’s mean.”</p>
<p>“It’s an observation.”</p>
<p>“Same thing, coming from you.”</p>
<p>He almost smiled. Not quite. Then he said, “I don’t actually think you’re wrong about everything. The sprinkler was insane, but the impulse behind it — wanting to give people back a moment they lost — that’s not nothing.”</p>
<p>I didn’t know what to do with that. I’d been ready for the diagnosis, not the partial acquittal.</p>
<hr>
<p>I went to Priya the next morning. No earpiece. No binder. No run of show.</p>
<p>“I’m sorry,” I said. “Not — not the big version. I don’t have a gesture for this. I just — I’m sorry I made your engagement about my idea of what your engagement should be. I’m sorry about the earpiece. And the sprinkler. And the binder. And, God, the practice dinner.”</p>
<p>“And the napkin fire?”</p>
<p>“I take partial credit for the napkin fire.”</p>
<p>She didn’t laugh. She sort of exhaled through her nose in a way that was adjacent to laughing, and then she said, “I need you to not fix this one, Jules. I need you to just be my friend at my party and not have a plan.”</p>
<p>“I can do that.”</p>
<p>“Can you, though?”</p>
<p>That was fair. I didn’t answer, because the honest answer was <em>probably not entirely</em>, and we both knew it.</p>
<p>Priya and Dev worked it out themselves. Elliot helped — or rather, Elliot created conditions in which they could help themselves, which is a distinction I now understand and formerly would have found enraging. They talked. They decided the engagement party would still happen, but simpler. No chronological playlist. No reconstructed first dates. Just a room full of people who loved them and food from their favorite Laotian place and whatever songs came on when someone handed Dev the aux cord.</p>
<p>I gave up control of the seating chart. I gave up the toast structure. I gave up the curated lighting scheme. I kept the centerpieces, because I am a work in progress and not a miracle.</p>
<p>When Elliot asked me to dance, I said yes before I could think of a reason to say something clever instead.</p>
<p>On the dance floor, surrounded by people who were having a good time without any assistance from me, I stepped on his foot almost immediately.</p>
<p>“Sorry.”</p>
<p>“You’re fine.”</p>
<p>“I had a plan for this, you know. I had a whole — I was going to wait until the third song and then —”</p>
<p>“Juliet.”</p>
<p>“What.”</p>
<p>“You’re dancing.”</p>
<p>I was. Badly, and without a plan, and his hand was on my back, and I didn’t have a single note card telling me what to do next.</p>
<hr>
<p>My phone buzzed at 11:47 p.m.</p>
<p>Ravi: <em>So Suki and I made up. I’m going to propose. How should I do it?</em></p>
<p>I stared at the screen. My thumbs hovered over the keyboard, and I could feel it — the whole machinery spinning up, the plans forming, the Pinterest boards assembling themselves in the background of my brain like a Broadway show going into tech rehearsal.</p>
<p>I typed: <em>First of all, do NOT get a puppy. Second —</em></p>
<p>I deleted it. Typed: <em>Ask her what she wants.</em></p>
<p>Then, after a pause that cost me more than I’d like to admit, I typed: <em>But if you need help with the logistics, I know a place on Division Street that does a really nice corner booth.</em></p>
<p>Across the room, Elliot caught me looking at my phone and gave me the expression of a man who knows exactly what you’re doing and has decided to find it endearing rather than pathological. I put the phone in my pocket. He went back to talking to Dev. The party continued without my supervision, which was either growth or exhaustion, and I wasn’t sure it mattered which.</p>   </section> <div class="reading-footer" data-astro-cid-r24qxsko> <div class="reading-footer__nav" data-astro-cid-r24qxsko> <a href="/work/unsolicited/" class="reading-footer__back" data-astro-cid-r24qxsko> <svg width="16" height="16" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" aria-hidden="true" data-astro-cid-r24qxsko><path d="M19 12H5" data-astro-cid-r24qxsko></path><path d="M12 19l-7-7 7-7" data-astro-cid-r24qxsko></path></svg>
