I notice bindings before I notice faces. I can date a Penguin paperback by its spine color from across a room. I once failed to attend my own mother’s funeral because I was halfway through cataloguing a private collection in Fife and the owner had a first-edition <em>Waverley</em> that I could not, in conscience, leave unsupervised.</p>
<p>What I am telling you is that I am very good at looking at things and very poor at seeing them.</p>
<p>I arrived at Crossbell House on a Thursday afternoon in late February, the light already going pewter over the Dales, and the smell hit me before I had the car door fully open. Woodsmoke and lavender and, underneath, the damp mineral breath of old stone — the smell of the building itself, exhaling. I had not been back in forty-five years. The proportions had shrunk. The front steps, which I remembered as grand, were four modest slabs of Yorkshire grit. The door, which in memory loomed like a cathedral entrance, was simply a door, painted green, with a brass knocker shaped like a ram’s head that I had forgotten entirely until I saw it and then remembered with a jolt that went through my teeth.</p>
<p>Aunt Philippa was dead. Lung cancer, six weeks from diagnosis to coffin, efficient as she had been in everything. She had left me the house. Not out of love, I suspected, but because there was no one else, and Philippa had always preferred a pragmatic solution to a sentimental one.</p>
<p>I intended to stay forty-eight hours. Inventory the contents, sign the solicitor’s paperwork, put the place on the market, and catch the Saturday train back to Edinburgh. I had brought one overnight bag and a box of acid-free tissue paper, in case Philippa had left anything worth wrapping properly.</p>
<p>The housekeeper, Mrs. Dillard, met me in the hallway. She was a short, square woman with the compressed features of someone who has spent decades keeping her opinions below her eyebrows. “You’ll be wanting the blue room,” she said, reaching for my bag. “It’s made up. The others are in the east wing.”</p>
<p>“Others?”</p>
<p>“We’ve six guests. The storm’s coming in. Mr. Farr — that’s the solicitor — he arrived this morning. Then the Caldwells, the walking couple, their car died on the Hawes road. Miss Hatch is writing about country restaurants for some London paper. And Mrs. Darnton came day before yesterday, said she was an old friend of your aunt’s.”</p>
<p>Mrs. Dillard’s voice, on that last clause, went flat in a way I recognized. The flatness of someone reporting a fact she does not believe.</p>
<p>“I didn’t know Philippa had friends,” I said.</p>
<p>“No,” said Mrs. Dillard, and picked up my bag.</p>
<hr>
<p>The library was Philippa’s room. It had always been Philippa’s room. Even in the summers I spent here as a girl, the library was understood to be sovereign territory — you entered by invitation or not at all. The books were a working collection: local history, agricultural records, parish registers going back to the 1700s, and, unexpectedly, a full shelf of Golden Age detective fiction. Sayers, Allingham, Marsh, and every Christie ever published, all in their original dust jackets, spines barely cracked.</p>
<p>I spent an hour with them before dinner, pulling volumes at random, checking conditions. The Christies were first editions, every one. A complete set of Poirot novels. The jackets were in remarkable condition — Philippa had kept the curtains drawn, I suspected, to protect them from light. The <em>Murder on the Orient Express</em>, 1934 Collins Crime Club, was worth four thousand pounds at least. I held it for a long time, my thumb against the spine, feeling the slight give of the original cloth beneath the jacket.</p>
<p>This is what I do instead of feeling things. I assess. I price. I file.</p>
<p>Dinner was served in the kitchen because Mrs. Dillard was not, she made clear, running a hotel. We ate shepherd’s pie around the long oak table while the wind picked up outside. The storm had arrived faster than forecast. Snow was already drifting against the ground-floor windows.</p>
<p>Gerald Farr, the solicitor, sat at the head of the table as though it were his natural right. He was sixtyish, thin, with the kind of cuffs that get adjusted when their owner is thinking about money. He adjusted them three times during the first course. “The estate is quite straightforward,” he told me, buttering his bread with excessive precision. “A few debts to settle, but the property value more than covers them. I’d recommend a quick sale. The market for these places is surprisingly robust.”</p>
<p>“What debts?” I asked.</p>
<p>He adjusted his cuffs again. “We can discuss it in the morning.”</p>
<p>Dennis Caldwell was a large, quiet man who deferred to his wife in everything. He passed her the salt before she asked for it. He laughed a beat after she did, a loyal echo. Bea Caldwell was small and sharp-featured, with the nervous volubility of someone filling silence before it can fill itself. “We’re so sorry to impose,” she said, for the third time. “We were only meant to be walking the Pennine Way, but the car, and then the storm — Dennis, tell her about the car.”</p>
<p>“Alternator,” said Dennis.</p>
<p>“The alternator,” said Bea. “Completely gone. We were lucky to coast into the village.”</p>
<p>Rowan Hatch ate quickly and said little. She was younger than the rest of us — mid-thirties, dark hair cut short, a reporter’s watchfulness in the way she held herself slightly apart from the group, observing without joining. She complimented Mrs. Dillard on the pie. It was a professional compliment, designed to open a conversation about ingredients, which Mrs. Dillard deflected with the skill of a woman who does not discuss her methods.</p>
<p>Sylvie Darnton sat at the far end of the table, nearest the fire. She was my age or older, well-dressed in a way that had nothing to do with fashion — good wool, good shoes, the instincts of someone who buys quality once and wears it until it wears out. She said almost nothing during the meal. She watched me. When I caught her at it, she smiled and looked away, and the smile was wrong in a way I could not immediately classify. Too warm. Too knowing. The smile of someone who believes she recognizes you, though you have never met.</p>
<p>After dinner, the snow thickened. Mrs. Dillard reported that the phone line was down and the mobile signal, such as it ever was in this valley, had gone entirely. “We’re snowed in proper,” she said, with what I thought was a trace of satisfaction. “Nobody’s going anywhere till morning, maybe not then.”</p>
<hr>
<p>I could not sleep. The house was too loud. Not with noise — with memory. The floorboards under the blue room carpet were the same floorboards I had walked on at fifteen, sixteen, seventeen. The window looked out over the same stone wall, the same fell beyond it, the same darkness. I lay in bed and listened to the building settle around me, its beams contracting in the cold, and every creak was a page turning in a book I had put down forty-five years ago and never finished.</p>
<p>At ten o’clock I gave up and went downstairs to the library. If I could not sleep, I could at least work. I could catalog. I could impose order on something.</p>
<p>I did not go through the main door. I went through the pantry passage — a narrow corridor connecting the kitchen storeroom to a side entrance in the library, hidden behind a bookcase that swung on a concealed hinge. I had discovered it the summer I was twelve, and Philippa had been furious, not because I had found it but because I had found it before she was ready to show me, which disrupted her plan.</p>
<p>The bookcase opened silently. The library was dark except for the desk lamp, which someone had left burning. And in the wingback chair beside the fireplace, Sylvie Darnton sat with her head tipped back and her eyes open and a glass of whisky untouched on the table beside her, and she was dead.</p>
<p>I knew she was dead. You spend enough years handling old things and you develop a sense for when something has stopped. The stillness of the dead is not the stillness of sleep. It is the stillness of a book with no reader — complete, self-contained, indifferent.</p>
<p>I should have gone for help immediately. Instead I stood there and catalogued.</p>
<p>The fire had burned to embers, which meant she had been here at least two hours. Her right hand lay open on the arm of the chair; the fingernails on the index and middle fingers were broken, freshly, the white crescents of damage bright against her nail varnish. A bruise was forming on her left wrist — not the dark bloom of a strike but the mottled spread of a grip. On the desk, among Philippa’s papers, a journal lay open with a page torn out. The remaining stub showed a date: <em>14 August 1981</em>.</p>
<p>The library door was locked. I checked it. Bolted from the inside, the old iron bolt that had been there since the house was built. Whoever Sylvie had been expecting, she had locked them out.</p>
<p>Or locked herself in.</p>
<p>I touched nothing. I went back through the passage, closed the bookcase behind me, and went to wake Mrs. Dillard.</p>
<hr>
<p>“Natural causes,” said Gerald Farr, standing in the library doorway with his arms folded. He had come down in a dressing gown of surprisingly good quality — silk, monogrammed. “Woman her age, the shock of the cold, a whisky on an empty stomach. It happens.”</p>
<p>“Her fingernails are broken,” I said.</p>
<p>“She could have caught them on anything.”</p>
<p>“And the bruise on her wrist.”</p>
<p>“I’m a solicitor, Mrs. Ballantine, not a coroner. We should leave her as she is and wait for the authorities in the morning.”</p>
<p>He was not wrong, exactly. But he was wrong in the way that people are wrong when they want you to stop looking at something. His hands were in his dressing-gown pockets, and he stood in the doorway rather than entering the room, as though the library were a space he preferred not to cross into while Sylvie was still in it.</p>
<p>“How did you get in?” he asked me. “The door was bolted.”</p>
<p>“There’s a passage from the pantry.”</p>
<p>His eyebrows rose. “I didn’t know that.”</p>
<p>“No,” I said. “You wouldn’t.”</p>
<p>But Bea Caldwell, who had appeared behind him in the hallway, made a small sound — not surprise, exactly, but recognition. She pressed her hand to her mouth and turned away, and Dennis put his arm around her, and the arm was both comfort and containment, and I noticed both.</p>
<hr>
<p>Mrs. Dillard made tea. Of course she did. The kitchen was warm and the rest of the house was not, and we gathered there by instinct — all of us except Sylvie, who remained in her wingback chair.</p>
<p>“I need to ask you all some questions,” I said, and even as I said it I heard how absurd it was — a retired bookseller playing detective in a snowbound inn, like something from the very novels on Philippa’s shelves. But no one laughed. They were frightened, and frightened people will accept any structure that promises to explain what has happened to them.</p>
<p>I began with Gerald Farr because he was the most eager to control the conversation, and I have learned, over decades of dealing with book dealers who overclaim their stock, that the person most eager to set the terms is usually the person with the most to hide.</p>
<p>“You said the estate was straightforward. What debts?”</p>
<p>He adjusted his cuffs. Left, then right. “Your aunt took a second mortgage on the property eight years ago. The payments lapsed. The bank has been — patient.”</p>
<p>“How much?”</p>
<p>“Enough that the sale price will need to be competitive.”</p>
<p>“Gerald. How much?”</p>
<p>“Ninety thousand pounds.”</p>
<p>I let the figure sit between us. Philippa had lived frugally. She had no expensive habits that I knew of. Ninety thousand pounds does not disappear into shepherd’s pie and heating oil.</p>
<p>“What was it for?”</p>
<p>“She didn’t say. Client privilege would prevent me from—”</p>
<p>“She’s dead.”</p>
<p>He looked at his tea. “She was paying someone. Monthly transfers to an account I was not given details of. She was — insistent that the arrangement continue. Even when the money ran out. That’s when she took the mortgage.”</p>
<p>“Paying someone for what?”</p>
<p>“I don’t know. Truly, I don’t. She wouldn’t tell me. She said it was a debt she owed, and that was all she would say about it.”</p>
<hr>
<p>I found Bea Caldwell in the hallway, which was the worst place in the house for a private conversation — narrow, cold, lit by a single sconce that turned everything the color of weak tea. She was sitting on the bottom step of the staircase with her coat over her nightgown, and she had been crying.</p>
<p>“Your car didn’t break down by accident,” I said.</p>
<p>She looked up at me with red-rimmed eyes. “No.”</p>
<p>“You came here deliberately.”</p>
<p>“Dennis doesn’t know. He thinks it was the alternator. I — I loosened a wire. He doesn’t know about cars. He wouldn’t notice.” She wiped her nose with the back of her hand. “I grew up in the village. I knew Judith Lacey. Before you came for that last summer, I was her best friend. We were — we did everything together. And then you arrived, and Judith thought you were wonderful, and I was — I was fifteen, I was jealous, I was horrible about it. I told Judith things about herself that weren’t kind. And then she disappeared, and I have spent forty-five years wondering whether I pushed her toward whatever happened because I was cruel to her when she needed a friend.”</p>
<p>The hallway was so narrow that I could feel the cold radiating from the stone wall on one side and the faint warmth from the kitchen on the other. Bea’s face was very close to mine. The single light made shadows of her wrinkles, and for a moment I saw the girl she had been, the sharp jealous girl, preserved inside the sharp anxious woman like a pressed flower in a book — flat, translucent, still recognizable.</p>
<p>“You came for the journal,” I said.</p>
<p>“I heard Philippa had written about that summer. I thought if I could read it, I might finally know. Whether it was my fault.”</p>
<p>“It wasn’t your fault.”</p>
<p>“You don’t know that.”</p>
<p>She was right. I didn’t.</p>
<hr>
<p>Rowan Hatch was not writing about restaurants. She admitted this with the practiced ease of someone accustomed to dropping covers when they become inconvenient.</p>
<p>“I’m writing about cold cases,” she said. “Disappearances in rural communities. How villages process an absence — whether they fill the gap or preserve it. Judith Lacey’s case is one of six I’m researching.”</p>
<p>“And you came to Crossbell House because—”</p>
<p>“Because Philippa Ballantine was the last person known to have seen Judith alive. Because she never gave a full statement to police.”</p>
<p>She stopped there. I waited, the way you wait when someone has rehearsed an explanation and is deciding how much of it to share. She did not continue.</p>
<p>“It looks like a library full of detective novels and a ninety-thousand-pound debt,” I said, to see what that would shake loose.</p>
<p>“Who was she paying?” Quick. Too quick — she already knew about the debt, or suspected it, which meant she had done more research than she was admitting.</p>
<p>“I don’t know.”</p>
<p>She nodded, and something closed behind her eyes. She was good at her job, which meant she was also good at deciding when a conversation had given her what she needed.</p>
<hr>
<p>Mrs. Dillard was washing teacups when I came back to the kitchen. She did not look up. The rhythm of it — fill, swirl, rinse, set to drain — was a tempo she could speed or slow to manage the conversation, and she kept it steady.</p>
<p>“You knew who Sylvie was,” I said.</p>
<p>“Aye.”</p>
<p>“How long?”</p>
<p>“Since she arrived. She looks just like Judith. Or Judith would have looked, if she’d had the chance to get old. Same jaw. Same way of holding her head when she listens.”</p>
<p>“Sylvie Darnton is Judith Lacey’s mother.”</p>
<p>“Was.” Mrs. Dillard rinsed a cup and set it on the draining board. “She came for the journals. Your aunt kept journals for sixty years — every day, in those ruled notebooks from Smithson’s in the village. I’ve been cleaning around them my whole career. Sylvie — Mrs. Darnton — she wrote to your aunt six months ago. Said she knew Philippa had seen something. Said she was coming for the truth whether Philippa liked it or not. And then Philippa died before she could come, so she came anyway.”</p>
<p>“And the torn page.”</p>
<p>Mrs. Dillard’s hands stopped. The cup she was holding dripped into the silence.</p>
<p>“I read it,” she said. “Before Sylvie got to it. When I found it on the desk after your aunt died, I read it. Philippa saw something from her window the night Judith disappeared. She saw a figure near the stone wall. She saw — enough. She knew who it was. And she never told anyone.”</p>
<p>The kitchen was very quiet. The clock on the wall ticked. Outside, the storm pressed itself against the windows.</p>
<p>“Why didn’t she tell anyone?” I asked.</p>
<p>“Because the person she saw was someone she was protecting. Someone everyone in the village would have protected. I’ll not say more than that. The page will tell you, if you find it.”</p>
<p>“You don’t have it?”</p>
<p>“I put it back on the desk after I read it. Sylvie must have found it there. And whoever took it from this room after she died — whoever came through your pantry passage, because the door was bolted and there’s only one other way in — they took it to keep it hidden. Same as your aunt. Same as the village. Same as you.”</p>
<p>She turned back to the sink.</p>
<p>“Same as me,” I repeated.</p>
<p>“You saw something too, that night. Don’t tell me you didn’t. You left the next morning and never came back, and a girl doesn’t leave a place she loves like that unless she’s running from something she saw.”</p>

<p>The library, empty now — Gerald and Dennis had carried Sylvie to the cold parlor on Mrs. Dillard’s instructions, laid her on the settee under a clean sheet. I sat in Philippa’s desk chair. It was worn to the shape of her body, not mine, and I fitted into it poorly, my shoulders wrong, my hips shifted to one side. The chair remembered someone else.</p>
<p>I did not want to do this. I had spent forty-five years not doing this. I had built an entire life — Edinburgh, the shop, the flat with its ordered shelves, the solitude that passed for peace — on the foundation of not doing this. My profession was, in its way, perfect: I spent my days handling other people’s stories, bound and shelved and safely contained between covers, and I never had to open the one that was mine.</p>
<p>But Mrs. Dillard was right. I saw something.</p>
<p>It came back the way water damage comes to paper — not all at once but in spreading stains. The bonfire. August, still warm at midnight. Someone had brought cider. I was seventeen and trying to seem older, and Judith was beside me, and then she wasn’t. I went looking for her. Outside, toward the stone wall. The grass was cold and wet under my bare feet. I could still hear the music from inside, tinny and distant. There were two figures near the wall, and one of them was moving in a way that was wrong — not violent, exactly, but wrong, urgent, the posture of someone trying to hold something down or hold something back. I stood there in the dark with my hand on the cold stone of the house and I did not go closer.</p>
<p>I went back inside. I told myself it was the bonfire light playing tricks. I went to bed and in the morning Judith was gone and I packed my bag and took the bus to Edinburgh and I never came back.</p>
<p>I filed it. Like a book too damaged to sell but too valuable to throw away, I put it somewhere I would not have to look at it, and I built a life around the sealed room.</p>
<p>The bruise on Sylvie’s wrist. The broken fingernails. She had been gripping the arms of the chair — I thought so, anyway. It was the explanation that fit: she was reading the page, and what she read was terrible enough that her body reacted before her mind could, fingers digging into leather, hand clenching hard enough to bruise. And then her heart, which was sixty-eight years old and had been holding up a missing daughter for forty-five of them, stopped. That is what I believe happened. I cannot prove it. A coroner might find something else entirely — a blood clot, a congenital defect, something that had nothing to do with Philippa’s handwriting. But I don’t think so.</p>

<p>I found the page at dawn.</p>
<p>The storm was still going, but the light was changing — grey-pearl through snow clouds. I had been sitting in the library for hours, not sleeping, not searching, just sitting in Philippa’s wrong-shaped chair.</p>
<p>When I finally stood, it was with the restless compulsion of a body that has been still too long. I walked the shelves. I ran my fingers along the spines the way I have done in every library I have ever entered — reading by touch, feeling for the one volume that is out of place.</p>
<p>It was in the Christie. The <em>Murder on the Orient Express</em>, first edition, 1934. The page was folded twice and pressed inside the front board, between the free endpaper and the paste-down. Whoever had hidden it knew that a bookseller would eventually open this book. Knew that I, specifically, would not be able to resist a first edition in this condition. Knew that my compulsion to open and assess and catalog would lead me here, to this volume, to this page.</p>
<p>The handwriting was Philippa’s. Small, precise, the letters formed with the same rigorous economy she brought to everything. The date at the top: <em>14 August 1981</em>.</p>
<p>I held the folded page in both hands. The paper was Smithson’s — I could tell by the weight, the ruling, the cream color that had foxed to amber at the edges.</p>
<p>I could destroy it. I could put it back in the Christie and close the book and shelve it and let this be one more secret that Crossbell House kept in its walls. I could go back to Edinburgh and continue to be a woman who looks at things and does not see them.</p>
<p>Outside, the snow was still falling. The house creaked and settled around me, the same sounds it had made for two hundred years, the slow respiration of stone and wood and silence. Somewhere above me, the other guests were sleeping or not sleeping, carrying their own portions of the secret — Bea her guilt, Gerald his complicity, Rowan her reporter’s hunger, Mrs. Dillard her twenty years of cleaning around the truth.</p>
<p>I unfolded the page.</p>
<p>The story of what happened to Judith Lacey was written there in my aunt’s careful hand, and I read it, and the house went on breathing, and the storm went on, and the morning came no faster for the knowing.</p>
<p>I will not tell you what the page said. Not because I want to protect you from it. I will not tell you because the truth on that page belongs to Judith, and to Sylvie who died reaching for it, and to Philippa who died still holding it.</p>
<p>I read it twice. Then I set it on the desk where Sylvie had found it, unfolded, in the lamplight, where anyone who came looking could find it.</p>
<p>The snow kept falling. Upstairs, I could hear someone moving — footsteps in the hallway, a door opening. The house went on.</p>   </section> <div class="reading-footer" data-astro-cid-r24qxsko> <div class="reading-footer__nav" data-astro-cid-r24qxsko> <a href="/work/binding-and-foxing/" class="reading-footer__back" data-astro-cid-r24qxsko> <svg width="16" height="16" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" aria-hidden="true" data-astro-cid-r24qxsko><path d="M19 12H5" data-astro-cid-r24qxsko></path><path d="M12 19l-7-7 7-7" data-astro-cid-r24qxsko></path></svg>
