Which, as a romance novelist who hadn’t believed in love for eleven months, I should have been good at.</p>
<p>Instead, I rear-ended a stone wall.</p>
<p>Not just any stone wall. The stone wall belonging to Larkspur House Bed &#x26; Breakfast, Chipping Campden, Gloucestershire, which I’d booked for six weeks because my agent Priya said, and I quote, “Ramona, if you don’t deliver this manuscript by July, I will light your career on fire, and I will enjoy it.” She’d found the listing herself. Remote. Wi-Fi that worked. A place to “reconnect with the genre” without the distractions of my Brooklyn apartment — meaning the wine bar downstairs and my ex’s apartment upstairs.</p>
<p>The wall held. My rental did not.</p>
<p>I was still sitting in the driver’s seat, forehead against the wheel, cataloguing how many romance tropes I was currently living—fish out of water, dramatic arrival, imminent meet-cute—when someone knocked on the window.</p>
<p>“You’ve destroyed my gatepost.”</p>
<p>I looked up. He was tall and brown-skinned and furious, standing in the rain without an umbrella like someone who’d rushed out specifically to be angry at me. He had a clipboard, with a pen attached on a string.</p>
<p>“I’m so sorry,” I said, rolling down the window. Rain hit my face. “I’ll pay for—”</p>
<p>“That gatepost is from 1743.”</p>
<p>“Then it had a good run.”</p>
<p>His jaw tightened. He looked down at his clipboard and wrote something. I craned my neck to see. He’d written <em>GATEPOST — DESTROYED</em> in capitals, with a timestamp.</p>
<p>“I’m Ramona Reyes,” I offered. “I have a booking?”</p>
<p>He flipped a page. Scanned a printed spreadsheet. “You’re two hours early.”</p>
<p>“Surprise?”</p>
<p>“I don’t like surprises.”</p>
<hr>
<p>His name was Elliott Osei, and he ran Larkspur House with the precision of someone defusing bombs rather than arranging breakfast trays. Within twenty minutes of my catastrophic arrival, I’d been given a tour that was less “welcome” and more “these are the rules, and I have written them down.”</p>
<p>The rules were laminated.</p>
<p>No shoes past the boot room. Breakfast at 8:15, not 8:00, not 8:30. Hot water between 6 and 7 a.m., again at 9 p.m. The library books were alphabetized by author surname and he’d notice if I reshelved them wrong. Towels changed Wednesdays.</p>
<p>“What happens if I need a towel on Thursday?” I asked, mostly to see what his face would do.</p>
<p>A tiny crease appeared between his brows—not irritation, but the expression of a man encountering an input his system couldn’t process. He blinked twice, rapidly.</p>
<p>“Then you’d hang it to dry,” he said, “and wait.”</p>
<p>I bit back a grin. “Noted.”</p>
<p>He showed me to my room, which was gorgeous—exposed beams, a writing desk by the window overlooking a garden so aggressively English it could’ve voted for Brexit. On the desk: a printed welcome packet in a folder labeled with my name and dates of stay, tabbed by category: DINING, AMENITIES, LOCAL WALKS, EMERGENCY CONTACTS.</p>
<p>“Did you do the tabs yourself?” I asked.</p>
<p>“Yes.”</p>
<p>“They’re color-coded.”</p>
<p>“Of course they are.”</p>
<p>I looked at him—really looked. He was younger than I’d first thought, maybe thirty, with close-cropped hair and tortoiseshell glasses and a rigid posture that suggested his spine had its own laminated rules. His sleeves were rolled to the elbow in precise folds. He made me — a woman whose suitcase contained four pairs of leggings and zero real pants — feel like a natural disaster in human form.</p>
<p>“Thank you, Elliott,” I said. “Genuinely. This is lovely.”</p>
<p>Something shifted in his expression—a softening around his eyes that he quickly reorganized into professional neutrality. “Dinner is at seven. The other guests are away this week, so it’ll be just you.”</p>
<p>“Just me and you?”</p>
<p>“Just you. I eat in the kitchen.”</p>
<p>“Alone?”</p>
<p>“I prefer it.”</p>
<p>He turned to leave, and I almost let him, but I’ve never had the sense to leave a silence alone. “I’m a writer, by the way. That’s why I’m here. I’m writing a book.”</p>
<p>He paused. “What sort of book?”</p>
<p>“Romance.”</p>
<p>The look he gave me could have curdled cream. Not contempt — something more precise. Skepticism, curated.</p>
<p>“Right,” he said, and closed the door behind him.</p>
<hr>
<p>I didn’t write that day. Or the next. Or the one after that.</p>
<p>What I did instead was haunt the B&#x26;B like a ghost with a laptop, opening my manuscript at various atmospheric locations—the library, the garden bench, the window seat in the hallway—and staring at the blinking cursor. My protagonist, Sadie, was supposed to be falling in love with her best friend’s brother at a vineyard in Napa. Instead, Sadie was sitting in a car at the end of chapter three, engine idling, going nowhere.</p>
<p>I knew why, and the knowing was the worst part. I couldn’t write love because I’d stopped understanding it. My parents’ marriage had detonated nine months ago when my mother discovered my father’s second family—not an affair, a whole other family, in New Jersey, with two kids who had his nose and didn’t know I existed. And the thing I couldn’t metabolize into fiction was that my father had been the one who taught me to believe in big, sweeping love. He’d danced with my mother in the kitchen. He’d been my proof that the stories I wrote were real.</p>
<p>Turns out the greatest romance I’d ever witnessed was performed by an excellent liar.</p>
<p>So, yeah. Chapter four wasn’t happening.</p>
<p>Elliott, to his credit, said nothing about my obvious creative paralysis. He served breakfast at 8:15 — full English, beans in a separate ramekin because he’d noticed I pushed them aside the first day. He pressed the napkins into thirds, not halves. Thirds produced a more balanced fold, he explained without being asked. He refilled the marmalade pot before it ran out, remembering I’d scraped the last of it on my second morning and looked disappointed.</p>
<p>This was his language. Not words, not touch. Attention.</p>
<p>He’d re-alphabetized the library by genre after I’d mentioned browsing, and I found a stretch of books I wouldn’t have expected: Zora Neale Hurston, James Baldwin, Toni Morrison. Between the hardback copies of <em>Sula</em> and <em>Song of Solomon</em>, I found a battered paperback of <em>The Remains of the Day</em>.</p>
<p>“This is your section,” I said to him one morning, catching him polishing the banister. He polished the banister every morning at 10:00. I’d learned his schedule by osmosis, the way you learn the rhythms of a person whose house you’re living in—when the floorboards creak outside the kitchen, when the garden door opens for his evening walk, when the kettle clicks on at 3 p.m. for a cup of tea he drank standing up by the window.</p>
<p>He didn’t deny it. “I keep my books on the shelves because rooms look better with books in them.”</p>
<p>“And you filed Ishiguro with the literary fiction, not the Nobel Prize winners.”</p>
<p>“There isn’t a Nobel Prize section.”</p>
<p>“You should make one. You clearly love categories.”</p>
<p>He stopped polishing. The crease appeared between his brows again—the one I was beginning to recognize not as confusion but as the face he made when someone noticed something about him and he wasn’t sure whether to be pleased or exposed.</p>
<p>“I do,” he said, simply.</p>
<hr>
<p>The dare happened on day nine.</p>
<p>We’d settled into a routine—breakfast together (he’d started eating with me on day five, when I’d set a place for him and he’d stood in the doorway for ninety seconds before sitting down), then parallel silence in the library, him with his accounts and me with my dead manuscript. That morning, he glanced at my screen and said, “You haven’t typed anything in forty minutes.”</p>
<p>“I’m thinking.”</p>
<p>“You’ve been thinking for nine days.”</p>
<p>“Some thoughts take longer.”</p>
<p>He adjusted his glasses. “Is it the genre? You don’t seem like someone who writes romance.”</p>
<p>And there it was—the thing everyone eventually said, dressed up in different clothes. I’d heard it from my ex (“You write about feelings for a living but you can’t talk about yours”), from my father (“Mona, you’re too smart for those books”), from well-meaning strangers at parties who said “Oh, fun!” in a tone that meant “Oh, not real writing.”</p>
<p>My voice came out harder than I intended. “What do I seem like?”</p>
<p>He met my eyes. No flinching. “Someone who’s trying to write about something she’s not letting herself feel.”</p>
<p>Silence. The clock in the hallway ticked. Rain hit the windowpane in precise, rhythmic patterns that Elliott probably found soothing.</p>
<p>“Fine,” I said. “Fine. Here’s a bet. I’ll write something real—not my manuscript, something new, something honest. But you have to write something too.”</p>
<p>“I’m not a writer.”</p>
<p>“You’re a man with color-coded tabs and a laminated rulebook. You’re absolutely a writer—you just haven’t committed to a genre yet.” I leaned forward. “I’ll write something outside my comfort zone. Literary fiction. No happy ending, no love interest, just—truth. And you write a romance.”</p>
<p>His expression was a war between horror and the intrigue of a man who loves systems being handed a challenge with clear parameters.</p>
<p>“What would the stakes be?” he asked.</p>
<p>“Loser makes breakfast for a week.”</p>
<p>“I already make breakfast.”</p>
<p>“Then the loser makes breakfast while wearing the other person’s choice of apron.”</p>
<p>He owned seven aprons, all linen, all neutral tones. I’d bought one at a shop in the village that said <em>KISS THE COOK</em> in Comic Sans.</p>
<p>“Deal,” he said.</p>
<hr>
<p>I wrote. Not the Napa vineyard, not Sadie and her best friend’s brother, but something raw and ugly and true—a woman driving through New Jersey at night, trying to find a house she’d never been to, a family she’d never met. The prose came out spare and furious and nothing like the warmth I usually wrote with, and it scraped something inside me that had needed scraping.</p>
<p>Elliott wrote too. I’d hear him at night in the library — laptop keys, then occasional silences that lasted long enough for me to wonder if he’d given up. He hadn’t. When he showed me his pages on day fourteen, I held them with both hands.</p>
<p>He’d written a love story between a man who ran a guesthouse and a woman who booked in for the off-season. The man was autistic — Elliott used the word plainly, without fanfare. The man had routines that kept the world from overwhelming him, and the woman kept disrupting them, and instead of the disruption being the problem, the problem was that he liked it. That she made the chaos survivable. That she noticed the things about him that other people treated as inconveniences—his need for predictability, his specific food preferences, the way he couldn’t do small talk but could talk for an hour about Victorian architecture—and found them interesting. Not tolerable. Interesting.</p>
<p>It was clumsy in places. Some of the dialogue was stiff. He’d structured it with headers and section numbers, like a report.</p>
<p>It was the most honest thing I’d read in years.</p>
<p>“Elliott,” I said, and my voice cracked on the second syllable.</p>
<p>He was watching me with the careful attention of someone who’d handed over the most vulnerable part of himself and was bracing for carelessness.</p>
<p>“This is you,” I said.</p>
<p>“Parts of it.”</p>
<p>“The guesthouse owner.”</p>
<p>“Obviously.”</p>
<p>“He’s autistic.”</p>
<p>“Yes.”</p>
<p>“Are you—”</p>
<p>“Yes.” Said in the same matter-of-fact tone. Left-handed. Brown-eyed. Autistic. Facts about a person, not apologies.</p>
<p>I set the pages down. “The woman in your story. The one who’s running from something she won’t name.”</p>
<p>“Also obviously.”</p>
<p>“You wrote her kind.”</p>
<p>“She is kind.” He wasn’t looking at his manuscript anymore. He was looking at me. “She sets a place at breakfast for someone who didn’t ask. She notices which books I’ve read. She bought a terrible apron and it’s the funniest thing anyone has done in this house in three years.”</p>
<p>The banter had stopped. The performance had stopped. We were standing in the library of his guesthouse, and I was holding pages that described us in the thin disguise of fiction, and the truth of it was so naked I almost looked away.</p>
<p>I didn’t.</p>
<p>“My dad had another family,” I said. “That’s why I can’t write love. He was my evidence that it was real, and he was faking the whole time.”</p>
<p>Elliott considered this. He didn’t rush to comfort me, didn’t offer platitudes. He processed, the way he processed everything—carefully, thoroughly, with respect for the data.</p>
<p>“He wasn’t faking,” he said finally. “He was doing it wrong. Those are different things.”</p>
<p>The tightness behind my sternum cracked. Not painfully. Like a window letting in air.</p>
<p>“Your story needs work,” I said, because I was crying and needed to be saying something else.</p>
<p>“I know. The structure—”</p>
<p>“Not the structure. The ending. He never tells her.”</p>
<p>“Tells her what?”</p>
<p>“Elliott.”</p>
<p>He took off his glasses. Without them, he looked younger, uncertain, dear.</p>
<p>“The guesthouse owner in my story,” he said carefully, “has very little experience with this sort of thing. He’s not sure of the protocol.”</p>
<p>“There’s no protocol.”</p>
<p>“That’s extremely distressing.”</p>
<p>I laughed—a real laugh, wet and messy. I stepped forward. He didn’t step back.</p>
<p>“Can I?” I asked.</p>
<p>“Yes,” he said. “Please.”</p>
<p>I kissed him in the library, between Ishiguro and Baldwin, while the rain did its steady, predictable thing against the windows. He kissed me back the way he did everything — methodical, thorough, and so tender it made my throat ache.</p>
<p>When we pulled apart, he said, “I should note that this significantly complicates my guest relations policy.”</p>
<p>“You’re going to need a new laminated sheet.”</p>
<p>“Several, probably.”</p>
<hr>
<p>I rewrote the book. Not the Napa book—that was dead, and I let it go without grief. I wrote a new one, about a woman who’d stopped believing in love and a man who’d never trusted himself to try it. I wrote it messy and honest, with the humor back in but sharpened now, aimed at something real. The prose found a register I hadn’t known I had — warmer than literary fiction, sharper than what I’d been phoning in. I wrote the love scenes the way Elliott ran his guesthouse: with deliberate care, with attention to the specific and particular, with the understanding that doing something well means doing it as yourself.</p>
<p>Priya called it the best thing I’d ever written, then said, “Who is he?” Because six years of agenting teaches you to read subtext.</p>
<p>I called it the truest.</p>
<p>On my last morning at Larkspur House, Elliott served breakfast at 8:15. He’d made a full English with the beans in a separate ramekin. He was wearing the Comic Sans apron.</p>
<p>“I didn’t lose the bet,” he said, when I pointed at it.</p>
<p>“I know.”</p>
<p>“I just wanted to wear it.”</p>
<p>I grinned at him across the table—this precise, maddening man who’d written me a love story in section headers and kept Toni Morrison on his guest shelves and looked at my chaos and decided it was survivable.</p>
<p>“I’m extending my booking,” I said.</p>
<p>He pulled out his clipboard. Wrote something down. Turned it to face me.</p>
<p><em>RAMONA — STAYING.</em></p>
<p>Underlined. Timestamped.</p>
<p>I hadn’t believed in love for eleven months. But I believed in this — the improbable, meticulously documented truth of it.</p>
