<p>Not obviously wrong. Not wrong in a way that anyone else at the table would notice, not the way a forged signature is wrong or a missing person is wrong. Wrong the way a note played on a slightly detuned instrument is wrong — perceptible only to someone who has heard the original.</p>
<p>Her name was Lena Brovik. She was a visiting scholar from Oslo, here for the semester on a fellowship from the Ibsen Foundation, and she had loved Aldous Fenwick. I knew this the way I knew everything about Fenwick now: thoroughly, proprietarily, as one knows the contents of a house in which one has been living for eight months.</p>
<p>I was wearing his herringbone jacket.</p>
<p>The faculty dinner was at the Provost’s house, a limestone Georgian revival set back from the campus road behind a colonnade of sugar maples whose leaves, in the last week of October, had turned the precise shade of dried blood. There were fourteen of us around a table laid with the college’s formal china — cream-and-gold, Limoges, each plate hand-painted with the seal of the college, a laurel wreath encircling an open book — and the candlelight caught the wine in a way that made the room feel painted, staged, a scene from a life that someone had composed very carefully. I had not meant to come. For eight months I had been careful, exquisitely careful, maintaining the kind of social invisibility that requires more effort than visibility ever does, and I would not have come at all except that refusing a direct invitation from the Provost would have raised exactly the kind of question I could not afford.</p>
<p>So I came. I sat. I wore the jacket because it fit me better than anything I had ever owned, a fact that means something I have chosen not to examine.</p>
<p>The conversation moved the way faculty conversations always move at Whetstone — laterally, allusively, with the practiced ease of people who have been performing intelligence for so long that the performance and the thing itself have become indistinguishable. Someone mentioned Borges. Someone else corrected the pronunciation. A woman from the Art History department was telling a story about a forged Vermeer that had fooled the Dutch government for eleven years, and I listened with an interest I worked to keep below the surface because the story was, obviously, a little close to home. The wine was a Burgundy, very good — the Provost’s wife had opinions about wine the way some people have opinions about religion, quietly and absolutely — and I drank it slowly and felt the room soften around me, the candlelight and the oak paneling and the low murmur of educated voices creating something that was not quite warmth but was its convincing imitation.</p>
<p>Lena Brovik was seated two places to my left, past the chair of Dwight Ambrose, who held the Emerson Chair in American Letters and who was at that moment telling a story about Saul Bellow that everyone at the table had heard before. She was maybe fifty, angular, handsome in a way that suggested she had never wasted a thought on bone structure. Her hands were very still on the tablecloth. She was not looking at Dwight Ambrose.</p>
<p>She was looking at me.</p>
<p>I smiled. It was, I noted clinically, a good smile — the right amount of warmth, the right degree of self-deprecation, a smile that said <em>I know this dinner is absurd and so do you.</em> I had been practicing smiles for a long time. I have a gift for them.</p>
<p>Lena did not smile back. She tilted her head a fraction of a degree, the way a bird tilts its head when it has identified something on the ground that might be food or might be a threat.</p>
<p>“You knew Aldous,” she said, across Dwight, who did not stop talking.</p>
<p>“I was his student,” I said. “Years ago.”</p>
<p>“I know who you are,” she said, and the sentence landed with a weight I could not immediately parse — whether it was a statement of familiarity or a warning or something she was saying more to herself than to me. Dwight’s Bellow story reached its punchline. Someone laughed. The candles guttered. And I reached for my wine and drank it and the Burgundy tasted, briefly, like iron.</p>
<hr>
<p>I should tell you how I came to be here.</p>
<p>I came to Whetstone College on a scholarship when I was twenty-two, a boy from a town in central Pennsylvania where the chief cultural institutions were a Sheetz gas station and a volunteer fire company that hosted bingo on Thursday nights. I had educated myself ferociously, indiscriminately, with the desperate acquisitiveness of someone who suspects that knowledge is the only currency that cannot be repossessed. I read everything. I had no taste, which meant I had all tastes, which meant I could talk to anyone about anything, which is a more dangerous skill than it sounds.</p>
<p>Whetstone was the kind of place that appears in college guides described as an “intimate academic community,” which is a euphemism for a school so small and so expensive that everyone knows everyone’s business and pretends not to. The campus was absurdly beautiful — fieldstone buildings draped in Virginia creeper, a library with leaded glass windows that turned afternoon light into something ecclesiastical, a dining hall where the tables were oak and the napkins were linen and the conversation, on a good night, was about whether Montaigne’s skepticism was genuine or performative. I had never been anywhere like it. I fell in love the way converts fall in love: totally, obliteratingly, with the kind of passion that is really a form of disappearance.</p>
<p>Aldous Fenwick was the reason I had come. He was a literary critic of the old school — a man who believed that reading was a moral act and that criticism was a form of attention so rigorous it bordered on prayer. He had published three books, none of them widely read outside the discipline, all of them written in a prose style so precise and so devoid of academic jargon that his colleagues regarded him with the faint suspicion reserved for people who refuse to be boring. He was sixty when I met him: tall, stooped, white-haired, with a face that looked carved from softwood — all planes and hollows, a face that recorded everything. He wore the same herringbone jacket every day. He drank Lapsang Souchong tea. He kept a cat named Bartleby who preferred not to.</p>
<p>He was the first person who ever told me I was brilliant, and I have spent every day since trying to determine whether he was right or whether I simply learned, in that moment, how to perform brilliance so convincingly that it passed for the real thing.</p>
<p>I remember the afternoon he said it. We were in his study — the study that is now, by every practical measure, mine — and I had just finished a close reading of Sidney’s <em>Defence of Poesie</em> that I had prepared with the kind of obsessive care that other students reserved for first dates. Fenwick listened, his fingers steepled, his face unreadable, and when I finished he was quiet for a long time. Then he said, “That is brilliant, Julian,” and the word entered me like a key entering a lock, and something opened that has never closed. I did not know then whether the reading was actually brilliant or whether I had simply studied Fenwick’s own methods closely enough to produce something he recognized as his. I do not know now. The distinction may not matter. The lock opened either way.</p>
<p>Those first two years were the happiest of my life, and I say this with clinical detachment. I adopted Fenwick’s reading habits, his marginalia style, his way of holding a pen between his index and middle fingers as if it were a cigarette he was trying to quit. I learned to walk the campus paths the way the tenured professors walked them — slowly, with the unhurried gait of people who have nowhere to be because they have already arrived. I learned which wines to drink, which opinions about Derrida were fashionable and which were passé, which faculty members to flatter and which to provoke. I was, in the language of the discipline I had chosen to study, fashioning a self, and I was very good at it.</p>
<p>My dissertation was on Renaissance self-fashioning. The irony of this has not escaped me.</p>
<hr>
<p>The theft happened in my fourth year. I was cataloguing a private collection that had been donated to the college library — the estate of a deceased alumnus who had spent forty years accumulating first editions with more money than discernment — and among the books was a 1580 printing of Montaigne’s <em>Essais</em>, the Bordeaux edition, Simon Millanges, in remarkably good condition. Not priceless — books are always priced — but worth enough that its absence would be noticed.</p>
<p>I took it. I did not plan to take it. I did not struggle with the decision to take it. I was alone in the climate-controlled room with the book open on the table in front of me, reading the essay “Of the Inconstancy of Our Actions” — <em>We are all patchwork, and so shapeless and diverse in composition that each bit, each moment, plays its own game</em> — and I closed it and put it in my bag because it was there, because I was thirsty for it, because the distance between wanting and having had simply ceased to exist.</p>
<p>They found it three weeks later, in my apartment, on the nightstand beside my bed. I had not hidden it. I had been sleeping next to it.</p>
<p>No charges were filed. The college preferred discretion. Fenwick was the one who spoke to me last — not angry, not disappointed, something worse than both. He sat across from me in his study, his study that smelled of Lapsang Souchong and old paper and the particular mustiness of a room whose windows are opened only in July, and he said: “Julian, you are the most talented student I have ever taught, and I do not know whether there is anything underneath it.”</p>
<p>I left Whetstone. I spent six months in a studio apartment in Albany, working at a used bookstore, reading nothing, becoming no one. I had expected grief or rage or at least the productive self-pity of exile. There was only a flatness, a windless calm, like the surface of a pond in which nothing lives.</p>
<p>Then Fenwick died.</p>
<hr>
<p>Heart attack. Alone, in the cottage, in the study. I still had the key — he had given it to me in my second year, a gesture of trust so casual and so complete that I understood even then it was the most valuable thing anyone had ever handed me. I drove to Whetstone from Albany in ninety minutes. I let myself in. I found him in the leather chair by the window, his reading glasses on and a copy of Burton’s <em>Anatomy of Melancholy</em> open on his lap, and he looked like a man who had been reading and had fallen asleep and who would, if you shook his shoulder, blink twice and ask what time it was.</p>
<p>I sat with him for two hours. I did not call the ambulance, the college, his sister in Montpelier. I sat in the straight-backed chair across from him, the one where I used to sit during our Tuesday sessions, and I looked at the room — the walls of books, the desk with its green banker’s lamp, the Turkish rug with the wine stain from the night he’d been reading Keats aloud and gesturing too broadly — and I felt, for the first time since leaving this place, that I was sitting inside a life that made sense. A life organized around attention and beauty and the slow accumulation of understanding.</p>
<p>I called the funeral home. They came, and they took him, and I fed the cat. And then I did not leave.</p>
<hr>
<p>The slide was so gradual that I cannot, even now, identify the moment when maintenance became habitation. I stayed the first night because Bartleby needed feeding. I stayed the second night because there were dishes in the sink and it seemed wrong to leave them. I stayed the third night because I had begun reading a chapter of the manuscript Fenwick had been writing — <em>The Forger’s Mirror: Literary Imposture from Chatterton to Gaddis</em> — and I wanted to know how it ended.</p>
<p>It didn’t end. Fenwick had written seven chapters, rigorously, over six years, and the last three existed only as notes — fragments, questions, arrows pointing to books he intended to consult. The manuscript was brilliant and unfinished and I could see, with the clarity of someone who had spent three years studying under this man, exactly what he had meant to say.</p>
<p>I answered an email from his editor. Patricia Oakes, at Knopf. She wrote to “the estate of Aldous Fenwick” — the college had posted a brief obituary but Fenwick had been private enough that the wider literary world barely noticed his passing — asking about the manuscript’s status. I replied that the final chapters had been found in draft form and were being prepared for submission. I did not say by whom. The email had a warmth to it, a careful optimism, that I had not felt in myself for months.</p>
<p>I wrote a paragraph. Then a page. Then I was writing chapters, sitting at his desk, drinking his tea — I had switched from Earl Grey to Lapsang Souchong without deciding to, the way one absorbs an accent in a foreign country — wearing his jacket, using his fountain pen, a Montblanc Meisterstuck with a medium nib that laid down ink in a line so clean it made my handwriting look better than it was. I wrote in the mornings, as he had. I walked to the village post office in the afternoons. I nodded to the woman at the cheese shop. No one questioned me. I was Julian Ault, house-sitting for the estate, handling the papers, a former student performing a final act of devotion. That was the story and it was almost entirely true. The “almost” is where I live.</p>
<hr>
<p>The manuscript was the best thing I had ever written.</p>
<p>I say “I” deliberately. The voice was Fenwick’s — his rhythms, his allusions, his way of constructing an argument through the accumulation of luminous detail rather than the blunt deployment of a thesis — but the thinking was mine, and the thinking was better. Fenwick had been careful, meticulous, a scholar who never wrote a sentence without three sources to support it. I was reckless. I made connections Fenwick would have hesitated over. I argued that literary imposture was not a failure of authenticity but the purest expression of what literature does — the construction of a self through language, a self that exists nowhere else, a self that is more real than the body producing it. I was writing about Chatterton, about Macpherson’s Ossian, about the forged Hitler diaries, but I was also writing about myself, and the writing had an urgency that Fenwick’s careful scholarship had never achieved.</p>
<p>This is the part where I should feel guilt. I do not. The absence is not a performance. It is not defiance or repression. I have patted down the pockets of my character and they are empty. What I feel instead is a low, continuous hum of something I can only call <em>rightness</em> — a mechanism functioning as designed.</p>
<hr>
<p>Lena Brovik came to the cottage for the first time on a Tuesday in late September.</p>
<p>She stood in the doorway with her coat still buttoned and looked past me into the hall, into the room beyond where the bookshelves rose to the ceiling and the green banker’s lamp was on and Bartleby was sleeping on the manuscript pages I’d left on the desk, and her face did something I couldn’t read. It was the face of someone walking into a room they recognize from memory and finding it changed in ways too small to name.</p>
<p>“I wrote to Aldous,” she said. “Last spring. He didn’t answer. I thought he was being — you know — he could be very silent when he wanted to be.”</p>
<p>“He could,” I said. I said it gently, with a faint amusement, acknowledging a shared understanding. I had not planned to say it that way. It came out of me the way Fenwick’s tea preference had come, his handwriting, his habit of standing at the window with his hands clasped behind his back — by a process that was less imitation than absorption, the slow molecular replacement of one substance by another.</p>
<p>She wanted to look through his papers. She said he had written her letters — she called them letters, though I suspected they were emails — during the period of what she described, with Scandinavian precision, as “our intellectual friendship.” She wanted them for a memorial essay she was writing. I could not refuse without arousing suspicion, so I said yes, and I gave her access to the filing cabinets in the study, and I made her a cup of Lapsang Souchong, and I watched her from the kitchen doorway as she opened the first drawer and began to read.</p>
<p>She came back on Thursday. Then the following Tuesday. Then she was coming twice a week, and each time she stayed longer, and each time she noticed something.</p>
<p>“You’ve rearranged the desk,” she said once, running her finger along the edge where Fenwick had kept a row of reference books that I had moved to the shelf.</p>
<p>“It was cluttered,” I said.</p>
<p>“Aldous liked clutter.”</p>
<p>“I know.”</p>
<p>She looked at me. The look lasted a beat too long. I smiled.</p>
<p>“His tea was different,” she said on another visit, holding the cup I’d given her close to her face. “Smokier. He bought it from a place in the village.”</p>
<p>“I order it online,” I said, and she nodded, and the silence between us was louder than conversation.</p>
<p>It was during one of these visits that I caught myself telling her an anecdote about a conference in Dubrovnik — a story about a dinner with a Croatian translator who had been so drunk he’d tried to recite the entirety of <em>Hamlet</em> in Serbo-Croatian and made it all the way to Act Three before anyone stopped him. I was three sentences into the story before I realized it had not happened to me. It had happened to Fenwick. He had told it to me during one of our Tuesday sessions, years ago, and I had stored it not as information but as material, raw substance from which a self could be assembled.</p>
<p>I stopped mid-sentence. Lena was watching me with that expression again — not quite suspicion, not quite anything else.</p>
<p>“Go on,” she said.</p>
<p>“I’ve forgotten how it ends,” I said, which was true: I had forgotten how Fenwick ended the story because I had been about to end it differently, the way I would have ended it, which was better.</p>
<hr>
<p>Patricia Oakes arrived in November. She flew from New York and rented a car and drove to the cottage on a Friday afternoon with the manuscript pages in a leather portfolio and an expression of emotional seriousness that publishers reserve for books they believe in. She was sixty, compact, silver-haired, with the energy of a person who has spent her life caring about sentences. She sat in the study and read the final chapters aloud — my chapters, the ones I had written at Fenwick’s desk with Fenwick’s pen — and when she reached the passage about Chatterton dying in his garret, seventeen years old, surrounded by the fragments of his own invented medieval poet, she stopped and pressed her knuckles against her lips and did not speak for a long time.</p>
<p>“This is the best thing Aldous ever wrote,” she said.</p>
<p>I poured more tea. My hand was steady.</p>
<p>“The last three chapters have a freedom that the earlier work doesn’t. As if he finally stopped being careful.” She looked at me with the kind of admiration that is really a form of gratitude. “You must have known him so well. Was he like this at the end? Freer?”</p>
<p>“Yes,” I said. “He was freer.”</p>
<p>“It’s extraordinary. This passage here — ” She turned back to the manuscript. “‘The forger does not lack a self. He has too many. The authentic person is a house with one door; the forger is a house with every door open, and the wind passes through without finding anything to move.’ That’s — ” She shook her head. “That’s not criticism. That’s literature.”</p>
<p>“He would have been embarrassed to hear you say that.”</p>
<p>“He would have pretended to be embarrassed. There’s a difference.”</p>
<p>Every word she read was mine, and every compliment she paid was his, and the sensation of sitting in that room hearing my best work praised under a dead man’s name was like nothing I have a comparison for. I was there and I was not there. The work existed and the person who wrote it did not. I poured Patricia more tea and she took it without looking up from the pages, and I watched her eyes move along sentences I had written at three in the morning with Bartleby on my lap and the green lamp burning and the feeling that I was, for the first time in my life, doing the work I was meant to do — doing it in someone else’s name, in someone else’s house, in someone else’s voice, but doing it.</p>
<p>She asked about the notes. Whether Fenwick had left any indication of how he wanted the final chapter to end. I told her there were notes, which was true — there were Fenwick’s notes, which I had read and set aside and then written past. What I had written bore no resemblance to what Fenwick had planned. His ending was cautious, scholarly, a summation. Mine was reckless — a sustained meditation on the idea that every act of literary creation is an act of forgery, that the self who writes is always an invention, and that the forger’s only real crime is being honest about what every writer does in secret.</p>
<p>Patricia stayed for two hours. She left with the full manuscript. She said Knopf would publish it in the fall. She said it would be dedicated to his memory. She did not say to mine.</p>

<p>In December, a letter arrived from Fenwick’s sister in Montpelier. I had been paying his bills from his accounts — the mortgage, the electricity, the property taxes, the online tea subscription — using a power of attorney I had forged. The forgery was competent but not inspired; I am better at forging prose than signatures. The sister wanted to know why the estate had not been filed with probate court. She wanted to know who was living in the cottage. She wanted to know what had happened to the first edition of Donne’s <em>Devotions</em> that she had been promised.</p>
<p>I handled this the way I handle all threats: I set it aside and continued working. I wrote a letter to the sister, on Fenwick’s stationery, explaining that the estate was being handled by the college’s legal office and that she should direct her inquiries there. I signed it with my own name. It bought time.</p>
<hr>
<p>Lena came to the cottage on a Tuesday evening in January, after dark, without calling ahead. I opened the door and she was standing in the porch light with snow in her hair and something in her hand — a leather-bound notebook, the kind Fenwick used for his private journals, the kind I had searched the cottage for and never found.</p>
<p>“I found it,” she said. “In the filing cabinet. Under the letters.”</p>
<p>She sat in the study. She opened the journal. I stood by the window with my hands clasped behind my back — Fenwick’s posture, Fenwick’s habit — and I waited.</p>
<p>“He writes about you,” she said. She was not looking at me. She was looking at the page. “‘Julian has the finest ear for prose I have encountered in thirty years of teaching. He can hear the rhythm of a sentence the way a musician hears a wrong note in an orchestra. But I have begun to wonder whether the ear is connected to anything else. He does not read to understand — he reads to acquire. He takes on the voice of every author he admires with a fluency that I confess I find unsettling.’”</p>
<p>The room was very quiet. Bartleby was asleep on the desk. The green lamp cast a circle of light that did not reach the corners.</p>
<p>“He wrote this before you left,” Lena said. “Before the book.”</p>
<p>“Yes.”</p>
<p>She turned the page. “‘I gave Julian the key today. I should not have.’” She paused, reading ahead silently, then closed the journal without finishing the passage.</p>
<p>She looked at me. In the lamplight her face had the quality of a painting — the kind where the subject’s expression changes depending on where you stand.</p>
<p>“He knew,” she said. “Didn’t he.”</p>
<p>It was not a question. I said nothing.</p>
<p>“Are you going to finish the book?” she asked.</p>
<p>“It’s finished.”</p>
<p>She nodded. She stood. She buttoned her coat. At the door she turned and looked at me one more time, and then she left.</p>
<p>I locked the door. I fed the cat.</p>

<p>The book was published in September. <em>The Forger’s Mirror</em>, by Aldous Fenwick. The reviews were warm, respectful, admiring in the way that reviews of posthumous works are always admiring — the reverence that death confers on the merely good. But the final chapters were singled out repeatedly. “A late flowering.” “The most vital writing of his career.” “As if Fenwick, at the end, finally allowed himself to be reckless.” One reviewer, in the <em>Times Literary Supplement</em>, wrote that the final chapter’s meditation on literary imposture “reads less like criticism than like confession,” and I read this sentence seven times in the cottage study, under the green lamp, wearing the herringbone jacket, and felt a satisfaction so deep and so impersonal that it was like watching a sunset: beautiful, distant, happening to no one.</p>
<p>Lena never called the police. The sister’s inquiries were routed through the college and stalled in committee. Patricia Oakes sent a check for the advance — made out to the estate — and I deposited it in Fenwick’s account and used it to pay the February mortgage.</p>
<p>I could step out of this whenever I chose. That was the thing I knew most clearly. I was not trapped. I was not lost. I was a visiting fellow — temporary, deliberate — inhabiting a space I could vacate when the time came. The cottage, the manuscript, the jacket, the tea — these were a project, not a prison. When the estate cleared probate, when the book had its moment, when the practical machinery wound down, I would simply go back to being Julian Ault. I would return to my own work, my own life, my own name. The fact that I had not yet identified what that work would be — this did not trouble me. It was a temporary condition. I was sure of this.</p>
<p>I stood in the bathroom. The mirror above the sink was old, slightly foxed at the edges. On the shelf below it was a framed photograph of Fenwick at thirty — dark-haired, sharp-jawed, standing in front of a bookshop in London with an expression of contained amusement, the expression of a man who knows something funny that he is choosing not to share.</p>
<p>I looked at the photograph. I looked at the mirror. I adjusted my jaw. I tilted my chin. I tried the expression — the contained amusement, the private knowledge, the faint upward pull at the corner of the mouth.</p>
<p>I held it. I studied it. I made a small correction to the angle of my head.</p>
<p>The light in the bathroom was failing, the pale winter light of late afternoon, and in the mirror my face was half in shadow and half in the photograph’s light, and I practiced the expression again, patiently, carefully, the way a craftsman practices a joint — not to learn it but to own it, to make it so natural that no one watching would ever suspect it had been learned at all.</p>   </section> <div class="reading-footer" data-astro-cid-r24qxsko> <div class="reading-footer__nav" data-astro-cid-r24qxsko> <a href="/work/visiting-fellow/" class="reading-footer__back" data-astro-cid-r24qxsko> <svg width="16" height="16" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" aria-hidden="true" data-astro-cid-r24qxsko><path d="M19 12H5" data-astro-cid-r24qxsko></path><path d="M12 19l-7-7 7-7" data-astro-cid-r24qxsko></path></svg>
