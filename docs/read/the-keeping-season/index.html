<p>I know that will sound strange, given everything that happened afterward, and given what people who were never there tend to assume about the place. But I think anyone who actually went through the program — anyone from my cohort, at least, the 16s — would say something similar, if you gave them enough time and didn’t push. The grounds were beautiful. The lake was real, not decorative, and in the early mornings before the wellness bell you could see the mist sitting on the water in long bands that looked solid enough to walk on. The food was better than you’d expect. The instructors, most of them, were kind.</p>
<p>I should be more careful with that word. Kind. Miss Alderman was kind. Miss Farrow, who taught Domestic Transitions, was kind. Even Dr. Ingram, who ran the quarterly assessments with her cold hands and her habit of humming while she worked, was kind in her way — she always warned you before she did something that would hurt. That counts for something. At Alder House, it counted for a great deal.</p>
<p>What I mean is that no one was deliberately cruel. That was the thing about the program, the thing outsiders never quite understood. The cruelty, such as it was, had been designed out. Or rather it had been relocated — moved upstream, into policy documents and allocation formulas and the Keeping Act itself, so that by the time it reached us it no longer looked like cruelty at all. It looked like breakfast at seven-thirty, wellness checks at eight, lessons until noon, rest period, skills rotation, dinner, reflection hour, lights out. It looked like a schedule. Schedules aren’t cruel. They’re just — how things work.</p>
<p>I arrived at Alder House in the autumn of my fifteenth year, which would have been the third year of the program nationally, though the pilot had been running in the lake counties for two years before that. My parents drove me. My father carried my suitcase to the front steps and set it down and stood there with his hands in his pockets, looking at the building the way you look at a place where you’re leaving something valuable, checking the locks with your eyes. My mother stayed in the car. I remember that clearly — the shape of her behind the windshield, the way she’d angled the rearview mirror so it wasn’t pointed at the building. At the time I thought she was fixing her hair. I was fifteen.</p>
<p>There were thirty-two of us in the 16s cohort. We slept in a long room on the second floor with windows that faced the lake, and at night you could hear the water against the dock, a sound like someone gently clapping, and in certain weather the windows would fog from our breathing and you’d wake to a world gone soft and white, the lake erased, the trees erased, nothing visible except the room itself and the thirty-one other beds and the thirty-one other girls in them, each one breathing at her own rhythm, and the combined sound of that was something I have never been able to describe to anyone who wasn’t there. It was like being inside a body. Not your own body. A larger one.</p>
<p>We knew, in a general way, what we were there for. It had been explained to us — not at Alder House, but before, in the preparatory sessions that happened at our regular schools, delivered by women from the Bureau of Maternal Allocation who wore grey suits and spoke in a particular tone I came to think of as the Explaining Voice. The Explaining Voice was calm and warm and slightly elevated, the way you’d speak to someone who was frightened of something that wasn’t actually dangerous. A bee, perhaps. Or a medical procedure that sounds worse than it is.</p>
<p>The birth rate had been falling for twenty years. This was the fact, the foundation fact, the one everything else was built on. It was presented to us with charts — pale blue lines descending across a white field, year by year, like a landscape losing its hills. The reasons were multiple and had been studied. Environmental factors. Economic pressures. What they called Demographic Unwillingness, which was their term for women choosing not to, which was itself their term for something they preferred not to name more precisely. The Keeping Act had been passed to address the crisis. It was a civic measure. A necessary measure. It had bipartisan support, which we were reminded of frequently, as though the number of people who agreed with a thing determined whether the thing was good.</p>
<p>The program selected girls at fourteen based on a battery of tests — physical, genetic, psychological. I scored well. My mother, when she received the letter, sat down at the kitchen table and read it twice and then folded it along its original creases and put it back in the envelope and said, Well, Lena, that’s that. She said it the way she said most things: with a steadiness that I understood, even then, was not the same as calm.</p>
<p>At Alder House we studied the usual subjects — literature, mathematics, history — but the curriculum had been adjusted. In history we learned about population crises: the Black Death, the post-war baby boom, the one-child policy in China, which was presented as a cautionary tale about government overreach, a framing I found confusing even at the time, though I didn’t say so. In biology we studied reproductive systems with a thoroughness that went well beyond what I’d learned at my previous school. Miss Farrow’s Domestic Transitions course covered cooking, household management, infant care, and something called Emotional Preparation, which involved sitting in a circle and discussing how we felt about our futures in language that had been pre-approved.</p>
<p>I should explain about the language. At Alder House, certain words were preferred and others were discouraged, though nothing was technically forbidden. We were Keepers, not — well, there were other words, words you’d hear outside, words that carried an ugliness the program had worked to remove. Our future partners were Assignees, not husbands, because the relationship was a civic arrangement, not a romantic one, though romance was “not discouraged.” The children we would bear were Contributions, a word I found perfectly normal for three years and now find difficult to say without pausing. The entire process — selection, education, assignment, conception, delivery, reassignment — was called the Keeping. As in: to keep something going. To keep the future.</p>
<p>We didn’t talk about it much, the Keeping itself. Not the way you’d think. Not with dread or resistance or even, most of the time, with curiosity. It was there, the way the lake was there — visible from every window, present in every conversation even when no one mentioned it, shaping the grounds and the schedule and the particular quality of light in the long dormitory. You learned to navigate around it. You learned which thoughts were productive and which were what Miss Alderman called circular, meaning they went nowhere useful, meaning they led you back to the question that was — and I can see this now, though I couldn’t then, or wouldn’t — the only question that mattered, which was: Is this right?</p>
<p>But that question. I want to be honest about this. That question didn’t come to most of us in the way people imagine. It wasn’t a thunderclap. It wasn’t Saoirse Phelan standing up in the dining hall and declaring that she wouldn’t participate, which is how it’s been reported and which is, I should say, not quite what happened. What happened is that Saoirse asked for more bread and when told there was no more she said, I’d like to speak to someone about the bread situation, and the way she said it — with a formality that was somehow both absurd and dangerous — made everyone in the room go still. Not because of the bread. Because of the tone. Because Saoirse had used the Explaining Voice back at them, had turned it around, and in that reversal something became visible that had been invisible before, the way you can live in a house for years and never notice the bars on the windows because they’ve been painted to match the frames.</p>
<p>They moved Saoirse to another facility. Miss Alderman told us it was a transfer, a better fit, and her voice when she said it was so kind and so steady that I believed her, or made myself believe her, which at Alder House amounted to the same thing.</p>
<p>I want to talk about Bea. I know I should have introduced her earlier — that’s what stories do, they establish the important people straight away so you know where to look. But at Alder House, the important people revealed themselves slowly, the way the lake revealed its depth only when you were already swimming and your feet, reaching down, found nothing.</p>
<p>Bea’s bed was four beds from mine, close enough that I could hear her breathing but not close enough to whisper without the others hearing. She had arrived the same day as me, in a car that was newer than ours, driven by a father who did not get out. She had light brown hair that she wore in a braid so tight it pulled at her temples, and she had a habit, during Emotional Preparation, of saying things that were technically within the approved language but that somehow bent the words until they meant something else.</p>
<p>When we practiced holding the weighted dolls — they were called Simulants, and they were weighted to match a newborn at various stages, and their faces were blank, which was supposed to prevent attachment but which had the opposite effect, because a blank face is a face you project onto, and I still remember the weight of Simulant 3 in my arms, the particular heaviness of something that should have been alive and wasn’t — Bea would say, Isn’t it interesting how heavy a contribution can be, and she’d say it with such genuine wonderment that you couldn’t be sure whether she was commenting on the doll or on something larger, and Miss Farrow would smile uncertainly and move on.</p>
<p>Bea and I became close in the way that people become close in institutions — quickly, intensely, with an unspoken agreement that the closeness was temporary and therefore precious, like fruit you eat faster because you can see the bruise coming. We walked the lake path after dinner. We talked about our lives before, which already felt distant, and about our lives after, which felt both inevitable and abstract, like a weather forecast for a week too far away to plan for.</p>
<p>Once, on the lake path, near the boathouse where the old rowing shells were stored upside-down like the husks of enormous insects, Bea stopped walking and said, Do you ever think about what they do with us after?</p>
<p>I said, After what?</p>
<p>After the contributions, she said. After we’ve done our part. Where do we go?</p>
<p>I said I assumed we went home. That was what the literature said. Completion and Reintegration, it was called. You fulfilled your allocation — three contributions was standard, though exceptional Keepers could petition for two — and then you were reintegrated into civilian life with a pension and a certificate and what they called Ongoing Gratitude, which I pictured as a card that came in the mail each year, like a birthday card from an aunt.</p>
<p>Bea looked at the lake. The mist was coming in, that low white mist that erased things.</p>
<p>Has anyone ever come back? she said. From Completion? Have you ever met anyone who finished and came back?</p>
<p>I had not. But that didn’t mean anything. The program was only five years old. It was too early for Completions. That was what I told her. That was what I told myself.</p>
<p>She nodded. We walked back. The wellness bell rang. We went to bed. The breathing of thirty-two girls filled the long room, and I lay there and did not think about what Bea had said, I actively did not think about it, the way you actively don’t look at something at the edge of your vision because looking would make it real, and I was good at this, I was good at not-looking, we all were, it was perhaps the most important thing Alder House taught us, more important than infant care or household management or any of the approved emotions: how to not-look at the thing that was right there.</p>
<p>The quarterly assessments were conducted by Dr. Ingram in a white room on the ground floor that smelled of rubbing alcohol and the synthetic lavender they pumped through the ventilation system, which was meant to be calming and which I still associate, all these years later, with the feeling of lying on a paper-covered table while someone measures you. I don’t mean measures in the normal sense. I mean: your hormone levels, your follicle count, your uterine lining, the precise dimensions of your pelvis, your genetic markers cross-referenced against the national database for optimal pairing. Dr. Ingram would hum — something classical, I think, something with a pattern that repeated — and her hands were always cold, and she always said, This will be a bit uncomfortable, before the speculum, and I was grateful for the warning, genuinely grateful, and that gratitude, that small gratitude for a small mercy within a larger machinery, is the thing I find hardest to forgive in myself now. Not that I submitted. That I was thankful.</p>
<p>There was a garden, too. I haven’t mentioned the garden, though it mattered more than I realized at the time. It was behind the east wing, enclosed by a stone wall that had been there longer than the program, longer than Alder House itself — the wall was old, lichen-covered, built when the property was a sanatorium, and before that a convent, and before that something else, and the fact that the building had always been used to house women in various states of institutional management was something I noticed one afternoon and then un-noticed, the way you un-notice things at Alder House, the way un-noticing became a skill as natural as breathing. The garden was where we went during rest period. We were encouraged to tend it. Miss Alderman said it was therapeutic. She said the physical act of planting was good preparation. She said this without specifying what it was preparation for, and we didn’t ask, because we knew, and because knowing without asking was another skill, perhaps the most essential one.</p>
<p>Bea planted sunflowers. She planted them in a row along the south-facing wall, and she watered them every day, and when they grew taller than she was she stood among them and tipped her face up and I watched her from the bench by the lavender beds and thought she looked like one of them — rooted, tilted toward the light, alive in a way that the program’s language couldn’t quite contain. She never harvested the seeds. She let them rot on the stalks, let the birds take them, and when Miss Farrow asked whether she wanted to collect them for next year’s planting, Bea said, I’d rather they went somewhere else. She said it lightly, but I heard it — the weight under the lightness, the way somewhere else meant something more than gardening, something that lived in the space between the approved words and the real ones.</p>
<p>In our third year, they told us about the Assignments.</p>
<p>Miss Alderman gathered us in the common room, the one with the tall windows that looked out over the lake, and she stood in front of us in her grey cardigan with her hands clasped and her face arranged in the expression I had come to know as the Serious Joy expression — serious because the matter was serious, joyful because the outcome was a blessing. She said that our cohort had performed exceptionally well. She said that our assessments showed us to be among the most promising Keepers in the national program. She said that Assignments would begin in the spring.</p>
<p>An Assignment, she explained, was the pairing of a Keeper with an Assignee — a man selected from the national registry based on genetic compatibility, civic standing, and what she called Complementary Temperament. The pairing would take place at a Facilitation Center — not Alder House, somewhere else, somewhere purpose-built — and the process would be supported at every stage by trained professionals who had our wellbeing as their foremost concern.</p>
<p>She said the word wellbeing and I watched Bea’s face. Bea was sitting two rows ahead of me and slightly to the left, and I could see only the side of her face, the taut line of her braid, the small muscle that moved in her jaw. She did not react. None of us reacted. We had been prepared for this. We had been preparing for this since we arrived, since before we arrived, since the letter came and our mothers sat down at kitchen tables and said, Well, that’s that.</p>
<p>After the meeting, Bea found me on the lake path. It was February. The lake was the color of pewter and the wind came off it in flat sheets that made your eyes water, and the water could have been tears, and that’s the kind of observation I would have made then — collapsing one thing into another, confusing the metaphor for the reality, which is another thing Alder House taught us, though not on purpose.</p>
<p>She said: I’m not going to do it.</p>
<p>I said: Do what.</p>
<p>She looked at me. She looked at me the way you look at someone who is pretending not to understand, and who you love too much to call a liar, and who you know will keep pretending because the pretending is what’s keeping them upright.</p>
<p>She said: Lena.</p>
<p>Just my name. That’s all. And in the way she said it I heard everything she wasn’t saying, and I also heard my own silence, which was not the same as agreement but which functioned as agreement, which was received as agreement, which in the economy of Alder House was agreement, because silence was the currency and compliance was the rate of exchange, and I have spent years since then trying to locate the moment when I could have said something else, could have said I know or You’re right or I won’t either, and I cannot find it, not because the moment didn’t exist but because I was not, in that moment, the person who could have spoken. I was the person Alder House had made. I was a Keeper.</p>
<p>Bea left three days later. Not the way Saoirse left — there was no scene, no reversal of the Explaining Voice. She simply wasn’t there one morning. Her bed was made, which was unusual; Bea never made her bed, it was the one small rebellion she maintained, the one crease in her compliance. The bed was made and her things were gone and Miss Alderman said, at breakfast, that Bea had been transferred to a facility better suited to her needs, and her voice was kind, so kind, and no one asked what Bea’s needs were, and no one asked where, and no one asked.</p>
<p>I helped clear her shelf in the common room. She’d left behind a book — it was a novel, an old one, from before, about a woman who escapes from a place where women are kept, and I recognized it because it had been on the Restricted Reading list, which meant it existed, which meant you could think about it, but you weren’t supposed to read it, and Bea had read it, had kept it in plain sight on a shelf in the common room, and no one had said anything, because the cover was obscured by a dust jacket from an approved book about gardening, and I held it in my hands and I looked at it and I put it in the donations bin.</p>
<p>I put it in the donations bin.</p>
<p>I need to say that again because it’s the part of this account that costs me the most to tell. I held a forbidden book that my closest friend had left behind as — what? A message? A gift? An act of resistance she hoped I would carry forward? I held it and I recognized it and I understood what it meant and I put it in the donations bin. And then I went to breakfast. And the porridge was good that morning, I remember. Slightly sweet. They’d added honey.</p>
<p>The Assignments began in April. We were taken to the Facilitation Center in groups of four, in white vans that had tinted windows and seats that were more comfortable than they needed to be. The Center was a new building in a new style — clean lines, pale wood, the kind of architecture that communicates efficiency and care simultaneously, like a hospital that wants you to forget it’s a hospital. Each of us had a private room. The sheets were high thread-count. There were flowers — real ones, changed daily. The professionals were professional. Everything was explained. Everything was consensual, in the sense that the word consent was used frequently and with emphasis, the way you’d repeat a word to a child who was learning it.</p>
<p>I could describe what happened at the Facilitation Center. I have the language for it — both the approved language and the other kind, the kind that lives in the body, in the specific memory of specific sensations that I have spent years learning not to revisit. But I find I don’t want to. Not because it was violent — it wasn’t, not in any way that would leave a mark a camera could find. It was gentle. It was so gentle. And the gentleness is the thing I can’t write about, because the gentleness was the point, the gentleness was the design, the gentleness was how they made it so that you could lie there and feel the flowers in the room and the thread-count of the sheets and the professional warmth of the professionals and believe, or almost believe, that this was something other than what it was.</p>
<p>I made my first Contribution nine months later. A girl. I held her for forty minutes. They said I could hold her for longer but I said forty minutes was enough, and it was, and it wasn’t, and I have no way to reconcile those two facts so I hold them both, the way I held her, carefully, with the knowledge that I would have to let go.</p>
<p>They let me name her. That was policy — the Keeper names the first Contribution, the Assignee names the second, and the third is named by the Bureau, from a list. I named her after no one. I gave her a name I had never heard before, a name with no history and no weight, a name that belonged to her and only her, and I will not write it here.</p>
<p>There were two more. The second was a boy. The third was a girl. I held each of them for exactly forty minutes. Not because that was the rule but because it was all I could bear, and I have learned — I learned at Alder House, in the long room with the thirty-two beds and the breathing and the lake outside the windows — that knowing what you can bear is a form of survival, even when it looks, from the outside, like surrender.</p>
<p>After the third, there was a period I don’t remember well. Not because anything dramatic happened but because my memory of it has the quality of a room seen through frosted glass — shapes are present, outlines hold, but the specifics have gone soft. I was taken somewhere. There were forms. Someone used the word Completion and someone else used the word Gratitude and I signed things and was driven somewhere else and the window of the van was tinted and through the tint the world looked amber, preserved, like something sealed in resin.</p>
<p>I am writing this from a Completion facility, which is what they call the place where Keepers go when their allocations are fulfilled. It’s not unlike Alder House, actually. There’s a lake, or what they call a lake — it’s smaller, more of a pond, and it doesn’t have the mist. The food is adequate. The staff are kind.</p>
<p>I have been here for four years. My pension arrives monthly. My certificate is framed on the wall of my room, next to a window that faces the pond-lake, and on clear mornings I can see to the far shore, which is perhaps two hundred meters away, and there is nothing on the far shore except grass and a wire fence that I assume marks the property line, though I have never been close enough to confirm this, because we don’t go to the far shore, because there is no reason to go to the far shore, because everything we need is here.</p>
<p>I think about Bea. I think about where they took her and what better suited to her needs means and whether she is in a facility like this one, and I think about the book she left behind and I think about the donations bin, and sometimes in the early mornings when the light is grey and the pond-lake is still and the breathing in this building — because there is breathing here too, there are others, we breathe together — sounds like the breathing in the long room at Alder House, I allow myself to wonder whether I made a choice or whether a choice was made for me, and whether the difference matters, and whether Bea would say it does.</p>
<p>She would. I know she would.</p>
<p>The wellness bell will ring soon. I should finish this.</p>
<p>I was a Keeper. I kept what I was told to keep, and I gave what I was told to give, and I was grateful for the warnings before the things that hurt, and I mistook the schedule for safety and the kindness for love and the gentleness for consent. I did not resist. I did not refuse. I did not read the book.</p>
<p>And the porridge was good. I want to be clear about that. It was good. They added honey.</p>   </section> <div class="reading-footer" data-astro-cid-r24qxsko> <div class="reading-footer__nav" data-astro-cid-r24qxsko> <a href="/work/the-keeping-season/" class="reading-footer__back" data-astro-cid-r24qxsko> <svg width="16" height="16" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" aria-hidden="true" data-astro-cid-r24qxsko><path d="M19 12H5" data-astro-cid-r24qxsko></path><path d="M12 19l-7-7 7-7" data-astro-cid-r24qxsko></path></svg>
