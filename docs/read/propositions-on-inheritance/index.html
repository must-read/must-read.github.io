<li>
<p>I have been thinking about the color brown.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Not the word, which is plain and Anglo-Saxon and closes the mouth on itself — <em>brown</em> — but the fact of it. How it arrives on the spectrum between red and yellow, which means it is warm, which means it absorbs more light than it reflects, which means, if you want to be precise about it, that brown is a color defined by what it keeps.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>My father’s skin was brown. I state this as one might state the color of a wall — not as metaphor, not as politics, not yet — because before it was anything else it was a fact of light, a particular frequency that his body returned to the world. When I was a child I put my arm next to his arm on the kitchen table and studied the difference. His brown was deeper than mine. I had my mother’s undertone, something golden in it, and his was closer to earth, to the bark of the walnut tree in the yard behind the apartment building on Halsted Street. I did not yet know that this observation — this innocent chromatic comparison — was the first lesson in a curriculum I had not chosen to enroll in.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>He died in October. I say “in October” as though the month were a room he walked into.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Maggie Nelson wrote 240 propositions about the color blue. She called it a practice of longing. I am not writing 240 propositions about the color brown, because brown is not a color Americans long for. Blue is the color of distance, of sky, of the romantic unattainable. Brown is the color of dirt and of certain people’s skin and of the cardboard boxes you pack when you are leaving and of the paper bags that, in this country, were once used as a test: hold the bag to your face, and if you were darker than the bag, you could not enter the room.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This is what I mean when I say that color, in America, is never just color.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>My father was born in 1944 in a hospital in Memphis that admitted Black patients through a side entrance. His mother labored in a ward separated from the white maternity ward by a plaster wall, and on the other side of that wall women were giving birth to children who would inherit a different set of propositions about what a body is for. This is not a metaphor. The wall was real. The plaster was real. The fact that his first breath of air came in a room designated for his kind of body — this was his inheritance, before language, before memory, before he could have known what any of it meant.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>He never talked about Memphis. He talked about Chicago, where his family moved when he was three, as though his life began at the city limits.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Proposition: every Black family in America has a city they do not talk about, and the silence is itself a form of inheritance, passed down like a name or a recipe or a tendency toward high blood pressure.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In <em>Notes of a Native Son</em>, Baldwin writes about his father’s death and a riot in Harlem as though they were the same event. I used to think this was a literary device. Now I understand it was precision. His father died of tuberculosis and rage and the accumulated weight of being a Black man in America who could see exactly what was happening to him and could do nothing to stop it. The riot was Harlem’s body expressing what Baldwin’s father’s body had already expressed: that there is a limit to what a person or a place can absorb before the container fails.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>My father did not riot. My father was quiet. His quietness was so complete and so practiced that for most of my childhood I mistook it for peace.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Brown: the color of the leather chair in the living room where he sat every evening after work and read the <em>Sun-Times</em> from back to front, sports first, then local, then national, then the obituaries, which he read the way some people read weather forecasts — checking for conditions in a region they would eventually visit.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Brown: the color of the gravy my grandmother made on Sundays, a roux of flour and drippings from whatever bird she had cooked, and this gravy was so central to the ritual of the meal that when she died my father tried to make it himself and could not get it right, and after three attempts he stopped trying and we never had it again, and I understood, though I was only eleven, that there are things that die with people and cannot be recovered, that the loss is not sentimental but actual, like a species going extinct — gone from the earth, not merely from memory.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I am making a catalogue. Nelson taught me this: that you can think by accumulating. That the fragment is not a failure of coherence but a method of it. That if you circle a thing long enough, from enough angles, you may arrive not at the thing itself but at the shape of your need for it, which is closer to the truth anyway.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What I need: to understand what my father gave me by not speaking.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>He worked for the city of Chicago for thirty-four years. Streets and Sanitation. He repaired roads. The work was literal — filling holes, pouring asphalt, leveling surfaces so that other people could drive over them without noticing. I have tried and failed to not read this as a metaphor.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Baldwin again: “The world is before you and you need not take it or leave it as it was when you came in.” This was written to his nephew. My father never quoted Baldwin, never read Baldwin as far as I know, but he enacted a version of this sentence every morning when he put on the orange vest and went out to fill the holes in roads that the city had let fall apart in neighborhoods that looked like the neighborhood we lived in, which is to say, neighborhoods where the residents were Black and the infrastructure was an afterthought, and the fact that the city paid Black men to repair the roads it had neglected in Black neighborhoods was an irony so embedded in the ordinary that no one called it irony. They called it a job. My father called it a good job. He had benefits.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I loved him. I say this now because I will not be able to say it later in this essay without it sounding like a conclusion, and it is not a conclusion. It is a fact that existed alongside other facts — his silence, my confusion, the distance that opened between us when I left for college and kept opening, not because of any quarrel but because I was becoming someone who used words like “systemic” and “structural” and he was someone who filled holes in roads and came home and sat in the brown leather chair and read the paper backward and did not, as far as I could tell, need the words I was learning, or want them.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Proposition: the distance between a child who goes to college and a parent who did not is not an achievement gap. It is a translation gap. I learned a new language. He did not stop speaking the old one. We met in the middle, which is to say, we met in silence.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Brown: the color of the bag of soil my father bought every spring at the hardware store on 47th Street to fill the window boxes my mother had installed before she left. She left when I was fourteen. The window boxes stayed. He planted marigolds in them every April — orange and yellow, never pink, never white — and he watered them with a Pyrex measuring cup because we did not own a watering can, and this single image — a large man in an undershirt, leaning out a second-floor window on Halsted Street, watering marigolds with a Pyrex measuring cup — is the image I cannot think about without my throat closing, because it contains everything: his tenderness, his stubbornness, his refusal to let the window boxes die, his inability to say what the window boxes meant, which was that she had been there, and he was keeping the space open, and the marigolds were not for anyone. They were evidence.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Evidence of what? Of a life that had an interior. Of a man who felt things he could not or would not name. Of what Baldwin called “the great discipline” — loving someone in a country that has made love difficult, that has made tenderness a luxury, that has asked Black men in particular to be strong, to be silent, to fill the holes, to wear the orange vest, to come home and sit in the chair and not need anything, and to perform this not-needing so convincingly that even their children believe it.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I believed it. I believed my father did not need anything. I believed this until he died and I went through his apartment and found, in the closet, a shoebox full of every letter I had ever sent him — fourteen letters total, spanning twenty-two years, which is not a large number, but I had not known he kept them, had assumed they were received and discarded, and the discovery that he had kept them in a shoebox on a shelf next to a pair of dress shoes he wore once a year to church was the discovery that I had been wrong about the most important thing, which was his interior life, which existed, which was vast, which I had been too busy becoming someone else to ask about.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Nelson writes: “I have been trying, for some time now, to find dignity in my longing.” I read this sentence and thought of my father’s marigolds.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Brown: the color of his hands. Large hands, scarred from asphalt work, and the scars were a lighter brown against the darker brown of his skin, a topography of labor written on the body. When he held my hand as a child I could feel the ridges. I did not know then that I was reading a text.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Proposition: in America, a Black body is always a text. It is read by strangers on sidewalks, by police officers, by teachers, by employers, by lovers, by the descendants of people who once considered it property. The body does not consent to being read. It does not get to choose its genre. My father’s body was read as laborer, as threat, as invisible, as large, as quiet, as compliance, as not-needing, and he carried all of these readings inside him the way a book carries its annotations — they become part of the object even though they were imposed from outside.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I carry his readings in my body now. A different edition. A woman’s body, lighter-skinned, educated, living in a different city, and the readings are different but they are readings still, and what I have come to understand is that inheritance, in this country, is not only what your parents give you. It is what the country has already decided about you before your parents have a chance to speak.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>He did speak, sometimes. Once, when I was sixteen and had come home angry about something a teacher said — I no longer remember what, only that it involved being the only Black girl in an honors class and the word “articulate” used as a compliment that was not a compliment — he sat in the brown chair and listened and then said: “They will always be surprised by you. That is their problem. Do not make it yours.”</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I wrote this down. It is the only thing he said that I recorded at the time, and I recorded it because it was, in its plainness, the most radical sentence I had ever heard. It contained an entire theory of selfhood. It said: you exist prior to their reading of you. Their surprise is a confession of what they expected, and what they expected is their poverty, not yours. Do not go broke paying their debt.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I have thought about this sentence for twenty years. It is the inheritance I can use.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Brown: the color of the casket. He had not specified. My aunt chose it. It was a modest brown, neither dark nor light, and as I sat in the front pew and looked at it I thought: this is the last brown thing that will hold him, and then I thought: no, the earth is brown, and the earth will hold him longer, and then I thought: no, I am brown, and I will hold him longest, in the only way the living hold the dead, which is imperfectly, in fragments, in propositions that circle but do not close.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>At the funeral my aunt sang “Precious Lord, Take My Hand,” and her voice broke on the word “hand,” and I thought of his hands — the scarred brown hands — and for a moment the word was not a word but a thing in the room, heavy and particular, and I understood that language sometimes works not by meaning but by weight, that certain words, at certain moments, carry the physical fact of what they name, and “hand” in that church was not a signifier. It was a hand.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Baldwin wrote the title essay of <em>Notes of a Native Son</em> on the day of his father’s funeral. He wrote: “It seemed to me that God, His Father, had devised, in order to make the wrath of God as real as the destruction wrought by man, a devastating lesson.” The lesson, for Baldwin, was that hatred destroys the vessel that carries it. That his father had been destroyed not only by the world but by his rage at the world. That the inheritance Baldwin refused was the inheritance of rage — not because rage was wrong but because it was, in the end, self-consuming.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>My father’s inheritance was different. He refused rage by refusing language itself. He let the silence protect him the way the orange vest protected him on the road — a barrier between himself and what was coming. And the silence worked, in the way that all refusals work, which is to say it kept him alive but it kept him alone, and the aloneness was the price, and he paid it every evening in the brown leather chair with the <em>Sun-Times</em> and the quiet apartment and the marigolds on the windowsill and no one to tell about any of it.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Proposition: there are two ways to survive what America does to Black people. You can speak, and the speaking may save you but it will cost you everything because the country does not want to hear it and will make you pay for saying it, and this is what happened to Baldwin, who died in France, exhausted. Or you can be silent, and the silence may protect you but it will eat you from the inside, and this is what happened to my father, who died in Chicago, alone. There is no third option. There is only the choice of which wound to carry.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I am not sure this is true. I am suspicious of binary propositions. But I am also sitting in my apartment in November with a shoebox of fourteen letters and a Pyrex measuring cup I took from his apartment and a photograph of him at a union picnic in 1987 where he is smiling in a way I never saw in person, and from this distance the binary feels less like an argument and more like a weather report: these are the conditions. Dress accordingly.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Brown: the color of the water that came out of the tap in our apartment every spring when the city flushed the hydrants. It ran brown for ten minutes, sometimes twenty, and my father would let it run and say nothing, and I would ask why the water was brown and he would say “They’re flushing the lines,” which was true and was also not the whole truth, because the whole truth included the question of which neighborhoods had their lines flushed roughly and which had them flushed gently, and who decided, and whether anyone had asked the people drinking the brown water how they felt about it. The brown water was temporary. The decision-making that produced it was permanent. My father drank it without comment. He had been drinking it his whole life.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What Nelson knows, what Baldwin knows, what the numbered proposition knows: that thinking is not a line but a spiral. You return to the same place and it is not the same place because you are not the same person. The first time I wrote “brown” in this essay it was a color. Now it is a country.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Nelson: “I want you to know, if you ever read this, there was a time when I would rather have had you by my side than any one of these words.” This, too, is inheritance — the admission that language fails precisely at the point where it is most needed, that the proposition cannot hold the person, that the color is not the thing, and the writing about the color is not the color, and somewhere in the gap between the word and the world there is a man watering marigolds with a measuring cup and you cannot get to him, not with 240 propositions, not with forty, not with the best sentence you will ever write.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>And yet. You write anyway. This is the Baldwin in it. You write because the silence is also a death, a slower one, and because the essay — the attempt, from the French <em>essayer</em> — is the form that admits it does not know, that circles because it cannot land, and the circling is not failure but fidelity, a way of staying close to the thing you cannot hold.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I am thinking about what I want to pass down. If I have children they will inherit this body — brown, read, annotated before birth — and they will inherit this country, which will still be itself, and they will inherit the silence and the language and the distance between them. They will inherit the marigolds if I can learn to grow them. They will inherit the shoebox if I can learn to keep things.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What I want to give them that my father could not give me: the sentence. Not any particular sentence but the act of one — the willingness to say the thing, to break the surface of the quiet, to let the words out even though the words are not enough and have never been enough and will not protect you any more than silence will.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Brown. His hands. The soil. The gravy. The chair. The casket. The bag. The bark. The water. The earth.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I have been thinking about the color brown, and I have not stopped.</p>
