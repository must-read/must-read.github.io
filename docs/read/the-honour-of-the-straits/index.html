<p>The wind had been foul since Tuesday, a steady tramontana out of the north-northeast that held the brig close-hauled on the larboard tack and set her lee rail groaning into the swell, and Doyle had been sick the whole time. Not a little unwell, not mildly indisposed, but catastrophically, heroically sick, in the way that only a man who has spent thirty-one years on land and eleven weeks at sea can be sick — a total and abject surrender of the body to the proposition that it has no business being here, that the sea is wrong, that all of this is wrong, and that the only rational response is to void oneself of everything one has ever consumed and several things one has not.</p>
<p>“You are looking tolerably green, Doctor,” said Captain Fenton, appearing at the companionway with the easy balance of a man who had been at sea since the age of twelve and who regarded any surface that did not pitch and roll as vaguely suspect. “Might I suggest a turn on the quarterdeck? The air is uncommonly fine.”</p>
<p>“The air,” said Doyle, from the darkness of his cabin, “is a poisonous fog of tar, bilge, and the exhalations of one hundred and forty men who have not bathed since Gibraltar. I thank you for the suggestion and decline it with every fibre of my being.”</p>
<p>Fenton laughed. He had a good laugh, open and sudden, the laugh of a man who found the world genuinely amusing rather than merely tolerable, and it was this quality — this unforced warmth, this capacity for delight in circumstances that offered precious little of it — that had first drawn Doyle to him, back in Port Mahon when they had been introduced at the Governor’s reception and Fenton had said, upon learning that Doyle was a surgeon, “Capital — I have been needing someone to tell me what is wrong with my liver, and the Admiralty has seen fit to provide one at Crown expense.”</p>
<p>They had become friends in the way that men at sea become friends: quickly, deeply, and with an unspoken understanding that the friendship was load-bearing, that it held up some essential part of the structure of daily life aboard a vessel where privacy was a fantasy and solitude a physical impossibility. Fenton commanded the brig <em>Douro</em>, fourteen guns, a vessel of no great distinction that had been assigned to patrol the approaches to the Straits of Messina and to discourage, insofar as a fourteen-gun brig could discourage anything, the French and their Neapolitan allies from moving men and materiel between Calabria and Sicily.</p>
<p>It was tedious work. The great fleet actions were elsewhere — off Cadiz, off Toulon, wherever Nelson was making history and lesser captains were struggling to keep up with him. Fenton’s war was a war of interception, of boarding parties and suspicious tartanes and long hours of watching empty sea. He bore it with good humour, which is to say he bore it as a man who understood that good humour was not merely a temperamental inclination but a professional obligation, the captain’s mood being the weather of the ship in a way that was no less real for being metaphorical.</p>
<p>“You will dine with me tonight,” Fenton said. It was not a question. The captain’s invitations aboard the <em>Douro</em> were not questions. “I have got a fowl from Pozzuoli that Killick assures me is a chicken, though I have my doubts about its ancestry, and there is a tolerable Marsala that will settle your stomach.”</p>
<p>“Nothing,” said Doyle, “will settle my stomach.”</p>
<p>“The Marsala will,” said Fenton. “Trust me. I have been prescribing wine as medicine longer than you have been prescribing medicine as medicine.”</p>
<p>They dined together most evenings, the two of them at Fenton’s table in the great cabin, which was great only in the naval sense — a space perhaps ten feet by twelve, with the stern windows opening onto the brig’s wake and the Mediterranean sky doing extraordinary things with the last of the light. The cabin was Fenton’s kingdom and his prison both, the place where he could be, for a few hours, something other than the embodiment of authority, something closer to a man with opinions and appetites and a weakness for Haydn’s quartets, which he and Doyle played together on violin and cello, badly, but with a sincerity that redeemed the execution.</p>
<p>They played that evening, after the fowl, which was indeed of uncertain provenance, and the Marsala, which was indeed tolerable. The tramontana had eased somewhat, and the <em>Douro</em> rode more gently, and in the amber light of the lantern the great cabin was almost comfortable, almost domestic, a small room with music in it that happened to be floating on several hundred fathoms of dark water.</p>
<p>“The andante,” said Fenton, tucking his violin under his chin. “From the top. And for the love of God, Doctor, mind the accidentals this time.”</p>
<p>“I always mind the accidentals,” said Doyle.</p>
<p>“You mind them in the sense of noticing them,” said Fenton. “I should prefer you to mind them in the sense of playing them.”</p>
<p>This was their way. The banter, the small rituals, the elaborate courtesy of mess life aboard a King’s ship — all of it a structure, a lattice of custom and conversation that made bearable the underlying reality, which was that they were two men in a wooden box on the sea, waiting to kill or be killed, and that the sea was indifferent to the outcome.</p>
<p>II.</p>
<p>The action, when it came, came in the usual way — suddenly, absurdly, after weeks of nothing.</p>
<p>They had been cruising between Scilla and the Calabrian coast, working back and forth across the strait in the patient, grinding manner of a sheepdog quartering a field, and on the fourteenth of September, a little before the middle watch, the lookout reported a sail bearing east-southeast, close inshore, running dark.</p>
<p>Fenton was on the quarterdeck within two minutes, his coat thrown over his nightshirt, his glass to his eye, and Doyle — who had no business on the quarterdeck during an action but who had discovered that he could not remain below while things were happening above, this being a weakness of character that he recognized but could not correct — was beside him within three.</p>
<p>“Corvette,” said Fenton, very quietly. “French-built, I think. Twenty guns, perhaps more. She is trying to slip through under cover of the shore.”</p>
<p>The <em>Douro</em> had fourteen guns. The corvette had twenty, perhaps twenty-two. The arithmetic was not encouraging, but arithmetic was not everything — there was also surprise, and the weather gage, and the fact that the corvette was close inshore with limited sea room, and the fact that Fenton was Fenton.</p>
<p>“We shall take her,” said Fenton, in the same quiet voice. “Mr. Harding, beat to quarters. No drums — pass the word quietly.”</p>
<p>The ship came alive in the dark. Doyle had seen it before, this extraordinary transformation of a sleeping vessel into a machine of war, and it still astonished him — the speed of it, the silence of it, men moving to their stations with the practised economy of actors who have rehearsed the same scene a thousand times. The hammocks came down and were stuffed into the nettings. The guns were cast loose and run out. The decks were wetted and sanded. The slow match glowed in its tubs, and the smell of it — that acrid, sulphurous smell — was, Doyle had come to understand, the smell of the thing itself, the irreducible reality of what they were about to do.</p>
<p>“Doctor,” said Fenton, “you will oblige me by going below to the cockpit. Your station is with the wounded, not with the guns.”</p>
<p>“Of course,” said Doyle.</p>
<p>He did not go below. Not immediately. He stood at the break of the quarterdeck and watched as the <em>Douro</em> bore down on the corvette, the dark mass of the Calabrian hills behind her, the water between them narrowing with terrible speed. The corvette had seen them now — there was activity on her deck, the faint sound of shouted orders in French, the crash of her guns being run out.</p>
<p>And then the broadside.</p>
<p>The <em>Douro’s</em> guns fired together, a single shattering roar that was less a sound than a physical event, a compression of the air that Doyle felt in his chest and his teeth and the backs of his eyes. The brig heeled with the recoil. Smoke bloomed white in the darkness and rolled downwind, blinding them, and through the smoke came the answering broadside from the corvette, the balls passing overhead with a sound like tearing canvas — that particular sound, the one you never forget — and then the maintopmast was hit, a terrible cracking noise, and the whole assembly of wood and rope and canvas came down across the larboard quarter in a tangle of rigging that trapped two men and killed a third, a boy named Whitcombe who had been fifteen years old and who had lied about his age to get aboard and who was now, very suddenly, nothing at all.</p>
<p>Doyle went below.</p>
<p>The cockpit was where the surgeon worked during an action, a space below the waterline that was notionally protected from shot and was in practice a charnel house lit by lanterns. Doyle had his instruments laid out on a chest — the saws, the tourniquets, the probes, the needles and catgut — and his loblolly boy, a silent Welshman named Pryce, was ready with the dressings. They waited. The guns fired overhead, a rhythm that was almost domestic in its regularity, and the wounded came down.</p>
<p>There is no need to describe what Doyle did in the cockpit that night in any detail. He cut. He sewed. He amputated a leg and an arm and held a man’s hand while the man died, and the man’s name was Farrell and he was twenty-three and he said, at the end, “Tell my mother I was brave,” and Doyle said, “I will,” though he did not know who Farrell’s mother was or where she lived or whether he would ever have the opportunity to tell her anything at all.</p>
<p>This was the work. This was what he was for.</p>
<p>III.</p>
<p>The thing that happened — the thing that this story is about, the thing that I have been circling like a man approaching a reef in fog — happened two hours into the action, when the <em>Douro</em> was locked yard-arm to yard-arm with the corvette and the issue was still in doubt.</p>
<p>Fenton had boarded. He had led the boarding party himself, which was either very brave or very foolish depending on one’s perspective, and the fighting on the corvette’s deck was hand-to-hand, cutlass and pistol, the oldest and most brutal form of naval warfare. Doyle knew this because he could hear it — the clash of metal, the screams, the particular percussive quality of a pistol fired at close range — and because the wounded were coming down faster now, men with cuts and stab wounds rather than the smashed limbs of cannon fire.</p>
<p>And then Pryce came down the ladder and said, “The captain is hit, sir.”</p>
<p>Doyle went up.</p>
<p>He should not have gone up. His place was in the cockpit. The surgeon’s place during an action is with the wounded, below, where he can do the most good, and this was not a matter of cowardice or courage but of function — a surgeon on the quarterdeck during a boarding action is a surgeon who is not operating, which is to say a surgeon who is not doing his work. Doyle knew this. He went up anyway.</p>
<p>The quarterdeck of the <em>Douro</em> was a shambles. The corvette was alongside, lashed to them, and the fighting was on both decks now. Fenton was on the deck — their deck, the <em>Douro’s</em> deck — with a wound in his side that was bleeding freely, and two men were dragging him toward the companionway, and the French were coming over the rail.</p>
<p>Doyle saw all of this in the time it takes to draw a breath. He saw the quarterdeck. He saw the wounded captain. He saw the French boarders. He saw Mr. Harding, the first lieutenant, who was twenty-four years old and who had never commanded anything more significant than the afternoon watch, standing at the head of the companionway with a cutlass in his hand and an expression on his face that Doyle recognized, because he had seen it in his shaving glass that very morning: the expression of a man who is in completely over his head and knows it.</p>
<p>And here is the moment. Here is the thing itself.</p>
<p>Harding looked at Doyle. The French were on the rail. The captain was down. The command, by every regulation and custom of the service, had devolved upon Mr. Harding, and Mr. Harding was frozen. Not frightened, exactly — or rather, frightened, yes, but it was not the fear that paralysed him. It was the weight of it. The sudden, crushing weight of being the man who must decide, now, in this instant, what a hundred and forty lives would do next. The weight that Fenton carried as easily as his coat, and that was now on Harding’s shoulders, and was breaking him.</p>
<p>Doyle could have helped. He could have said something — “Rally the men,” “Hold the quarterdeck,” “Fight, damn you” — any of the things that a man says in such a moment, the words that mean nothing in themselves but that function as a kind of scaffolding, a temporary structure that allows a man to stand when he would otherwise fall. He could have done this. He was ten feet from Harding. He could see the young man’s eyes.</p>
<p>He did not.</p>
<p>He went to the captain. He knelt beside Fenton and examined the wound and pressed his hand against it and felt the warm blood between his fingers, and he did this because this was his work, this was what he was for, and because Fenton was his friend, and because in the arithmetic of that moment the life of one man he loved outweighed the command of a ship he had no right to command anyway.</p>
<p>He chose. And the cost of the choosing was Harding.</p>
<p>The French boarders came over the rail. Harding stood there for perhaps three more seconds — three seconds that were, in the logic of a boarding action, approximately three centuries — and then he broke. He did not run. He stepped backward, once, twice, and his cutlass dropped to his side, and the men behind him, seeing their officer give way, gave way themselves, and the French had the quarterdeck.</p>
<p>They lost the quarterdeck for four minutes. Four minutes during which the French held the heart of the ship and the issue hung in absolute doubt, until the bosun — a man named Cork, built like a capstan and approximately as communicative — led a counterattack from the waist with a party of topmen armed with handspikes and boarding axes, and took it back by main force, and the corvette struck her colours twenty minutes after that, and the action was over.</p>
<p>They had won. The <em>Douro</em> had taken the corvette, which proved to be the <em>Hirondelle</em>, twenty guns, carrying dispatches from Naples to Reggio and a company of infantry intended to reinforce the Calabrian garrison. It was, by any measure, a creditable action — a fourteen-gun brig taking a twenty-gun corvette — and Fenton would be praised for it, and promoted for it, and the prize money would be handsome.</p>
<p>Harding would not be praised. Harding would not be mentioned at all, if Fenton could manage it, because what Harding had done on the quarterdeck was the one thing that a King’s officer could not do, the thing that had no place in the official account, the thing that was not spoken of.</p>
<p>Fenton survived. Doyle’s hands — the same hands that had not reached out to steady Harding, that had chosen the captain over the lieutenant, the friend over the stranger — Doyle’s hands saved him. The wound was deep but clean, and Doyle closed it and dressed it and watched over Fenton through two nights of fever, and on the third morning Fenton opened his eyes and said, “We took her, then?”</p>
<p>“You took her,” said Doyle.</p>
<p>“Good,” said Fenton, and closed his eyes, and slept.</p>
<p>IV.</p>
<p>The inquiry, such as it was, took place in Valletta three weeks later, in a room overlooking the Grand Harbour where the light came in through tall windows and fell across a table at which three captains sat in their best coats and decided the fate of a young man who had failed.</p>
<p>Harding was not court-martialled. Fenton saw to that. In his report, Fenton described the loss of the quarterdeck as a consequence of the maintopmast coming down — a structural failure, not a human one — and made no mention of Harding’s hesitation. It was a generous lie, the kind of lie that a good captain tells to protect his people, and it cost Fenton nothing, because the action had been a success and no one was inclined to look too closely at the details of a victory.</p>
<p>But Harding was quietly removed from the <em>Douro</em> and reassigned to a transport, and everyone knew why, because everyone always knows, because a ship is a village and a village has no secrets, and the story of Mr. Harding’s three seconds on the quarterdeck had passed from the <em>Douro’s</em> crew to the dockyard to the fleet with the speed and inevitability of weather.</p>
<p>Doyle watched him go. Harding left Valletta on a Tuesday, aboard the transport <em>Reliance</em>, bound for Gibraltar, and Doyle watched from the ramparts as the ship cleared the harbour mouth and bore away to the west, and he felt — what? Guilt, certainly. The specific, located guilt of a man who knows that he had the power to change an outcome and chose not to exercise it. Not the large, philosophical guilt of complicity, but the small, precise guilt of proximity. He had been there. He could have spoken. He did not.</p>
<p>He told Fenton, eventually. They were in the great cabin, three months after the action, the <em>Douro</em> refitted and back on station, and the Marsala was gone but there was a rough Sicilian red that served, and they were playing the andante again, and Doyle put down his bow and said, “I could have saved Harding.”</p>
<p>Fenton did not stop playing. He finished the phrase, set his violin on the table, and looked at Doyle with an expression that the surgeon had not seen before — or rather, had seen, but not on Fenton’s face. It was the expression of a man who is being told something he already knows.</p>
<p>“Yes,” said Fenton. “I am aware.”</p>
<p>“You knew.”</p>
<p>“I know everything that happens on my quarterdeck, Doctor. Even when I am lying on it bleeding.”</p>
<p>The silence that followed was not awkward. It was something worse. It was the silence of two men who have arrived at a truth that cannot be incorporated into the structure of their friendship without altering that structure permanently. Not destroying it — Doyle did not think this would destroy it — but changing its geometry, its load-bearing properties, so that what had been easy would now require effort, and what had been unconscious would now be deliberate.</p>
<p>“I chose you,” said Doyle. “Over him.”</p>
<p>“I know.”</p>
<p>“I am not certain I was right.”</p>
<p>“You were not right,” said Fenton. “You were a surgeon attending to your captain, which is your duty, and you were a friend attending to a friend, which is your nature, and these things are not the same as being right.” He picked up his violin again. “Harding’s failure was Harding’s. You did not cause it. But you might have prevented it, and that is a different weight to carry, and I am sorry that you must carry it.”</p>
<p>“And you?” said Doyle. “What weight do you carry?”</p>
<p>“The corvette’s,” said Fenton, and there was a flash of the old warmth in it, the old deflecting wit, but it died quickly, and he said, “I carry the weight of having written a report in which Mr. Harding’s cowardice does not exist, and of knowing that every man aboard this ship knows it does. I carry the weight of having protected a man by erasing him. These are the captain’s weights, Doctor. They are not yours.”</p>
<p>They played the andante. They did not play it well. The accidentals were a disaster. But they played it to the end, which is, in the final accounting, the only thing that matters.</p>
<p>V.</p>
<p>I should like to tell you what became of Harding, but I cannot, because the sea does not provide tidy endings, and men who fail at sea are not granted the narrative courtesy of redemption or damnation. He went to Gibraltar. He may have found his courage there, or lost it further, or discovered that courage and cowardice are not the fixed poles that the Articles of War suppose them to be but are instead weather — conditions that prevail or do not, that come and go according to systems too large and too complex for any man to predict.</p>
<p>What I can tell you is what became of Doyle, because Doyle is the man I know, and it is Doyle’s weight that I have been describing, and it is Doyle’s question that has no answer.</p>
<p>The question is this: when a man fails, and you are there, and you could have helped, and you chose instead to help someone else — is the failure yours?</p>
<p>Doyle carried this question through the rest of the commission, through the long months on station in the straits, through the news of Trafalgar and the death of Nelson, which arrived in October and which plunged the fleet into a grief so vast and so strange that it felt like weather, like a change in the barometric pressure that affected the behaviour of every man and every ship. He carried it through the refitting in Malta and the voyage home and the paying-off of the <em>Douro</em> at Chatham in the spring of 1806, when the brig was stripped and her crew dispersed and the small floating world that had contained his friendship with Fenton was disassembled and stored in a dockyard shed.</p>
<p>He and Fenton parted well. They shook hands on the quayside and said the things that men say — that they would write, that they would meet in London, that the friendship would endure on land as it had at sea — and both of them knew, with the knowledge that does not require articulation, that it would not. Not because the friendship was damaged but because the friendship belonged to the <em>Douro</em>, to the great cabin and the stern windows and the bad Marsala and the Haydn quartets played badly in the lantern light, and that without the ship the friendship had no architecture, no rooms to inhabit, no structure to be sustained by.</p>
<p>They did write, for a time. Fenton received his promotion and was given a frigate, and his letters were full of the new ship and the new station and the particular qualities of the new surgeon, who could not play the cello at all. Doyle returned to Dublin and resumed his practice and married a woman named Eleanor who was kind and sensible and who knew nothing of the sea except that it made her husband quiet in a way that she could not reach.</p>
<p>The question remained. It remained through the years, through the long peace and the children and the slow accretion of a life lived on solid ground, and it was always there, always present, a reef just beneath the surface that Doyle navigated around so often that the navigation became habitual, unconscious, a thing he did without thinking.</p>
<p>Until the night — a Tuesday in November, 1811, Eleanor asleep and the house quiet and the rain on the windows — when he sat in his study with a glass of port and allowed himself, for the first time, to consider the possibility that the question was not a question at all. That it was an answer. That he had learned, on the quarterdeck of the <em>Douro</em>, in the smoke and the noise and the blood, who he was — not who he wished to be, not who he ought to be, but who he was — and that this knowledge was the thing he carried, the true weight, heavier than guilt, heavier than doubt.</p>
<p>He was a man who would save his friend and let a stranger fall. This is not a noble thing. It is not a shameful thing. It is a human thing, and the sea had shown it to him, as the sea shows men what they are, which is its oldest function and its least forgiving.</p>
<p>The rain fell. The port was tolerable. Somewhere south, the sea was doing what the sea does — moving, indifferent, vast — and Doyle sat in his chair in his house in Dublin and carried his weight, and did not put it down, and this is where I leave him: a man who knows himself, in a warm room, in the rain, carrying the knowledge like a stone in his coat that he will not discard because it is his, because he earned it, because it is true.</p>   </section> <div class="reading-footer" data-astro-cid-r24qxsko> <div class="reading-footer__nav" data-astro-cid-r24qxsko> <a href="/work/the-honour-of-the-straits/" class="reading-footer__back" data-astro-cid-r24qxsko> <svg width="16" height="16" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" aria-hidden="true" data-astro-cid-r24qxsko><path d="M19 12H5" data-astro-cid-r24qxsko></path><path d="M12 19l-7-7 7-7" data-astro-cid-r24qxsko></path></svg>
