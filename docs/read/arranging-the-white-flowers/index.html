<p>Her mother did not use that word. She said the doctors had found something in her lungs and the treatment was not going well and she wanted Kavitha to know. She said this the way she might have said the plumber was coming Thursday or that the price of fish had gone up again. Kavitha stood in the kitchen holding the phone with one hand and a colander of washed grapes with the other and listened to her mother describe the progression of her illness as though it were a mild inconvenience, an administrative matter to be settled before the real business of living could resume.</p>
<p>“You should not worry,” her mother said.</p>
<p>“I’m not worrying,” Kavitha said, which was the kind of lie that becomes true if you say it firmly enough.</p>
<p>The grapes were for the fruit bowl on the counter, which Kavitha kept stocked because Neil liked to eat grapes while reading the newspaper after dinner. This was a habit he had developed in the first year of their marriage and maintained for nineteen years without variation, and Kavitha had learned to find comfort in it the way she found comfort in the sound of the furnace clicking on in October, the predictable rhythm of a house that worked. She set the colander in the sink and watched the water bead on the grape skins and thought about her mother’s lungs and about how strange it was that a person could be dying on the other side of the world while grapes were being washed on this side of it.</p>
<p>The cat was grey with white paws and a torn left ear. It appeared first on the back step, sitting very still in the weak March sun, and when Kavitha opened the door it looked at her without moving and she looked at it and neither of them did anything about the situation. After a minute it walked away, not quickly, disappearing around the corner of the garage.</p>
<p>She mentioned it to Neil at dinner.</p>
<p>“Probably a stray,” he said. “Don’t feed it.”</p>
<p>“I wasn’t going to feed it.”</p>
<p>“If you feed it, it stays.”</p>
<p>Kavitha cleared the plates. She ran the water and added soap and watched the bubbles form and thought about the word <em>stays</em> and how it meant one thing when Neil said it about a cat and another thing entirely when she said it about herself, though she had never said it about herself, not out loud, not even in the years when saying it might have changed something.</p>
<hr>
<p>She should explain about the town. It was called Nairn and it sat in a crease of farmland between Goderich and Exeter, in Huron County, Ontario. Four hundred people, more or less. A gas station, a general store, a United Church with a bell that rang on Sundays and sometimes on Wednesday evenings for choir practice. Kavitha and Neil had moved there from Toronto in 2009 because Neil’s firm was opening a satellite office in Goderich and the houses in Nairn were cheap and had yards. Kavitha had been thirty-one. She had been in Canada for four years, married for three.</p>
<p>The town accepted her the way small Ontario towns accept anything unfamiliar — slowly, politely, with a friendliness that was genuine but had a bottom to it, a floor below which no further intimacy was offered. The women at the United Church bake sale called her Kay. She did not correct them. She brought samosas to the potluck and everyone said they were delicious and asked for the recipe and she wrote it out on an index card and later heard that Betty Macleod had made them with ground beef instead of potatoes and had said they were just as good.</p>
<p>This was the kind of thing Kavitha noticed and kept to herself. She had a talent for it — for noticing the small adjustments the world made around her presence, the tiny accommodations and erasures, and for folding them into some interior space where they could sit without being spoken. Her mother had the same talent. All the women in her family did. It was not a gift, exactly. It was closer to a muscle that had been exercised for generations until it no longer required conscious effort, the way a potter’s hands know the clay without thinking.</p>
<hr>
<p>Diane Macleod — Betty’s daughter-in-law, who had married Stuart Macleod in 2015 and moved into the farmhouse at the top of the Eighth Concession — was having a birthday party for her son Jack, who was turning seven. She asked Kavitha to help with the flowers.</p>
<p>“You always make things look so beautiful,” Diane said, standing in Kavitha’s kitchen with her coat still on, holding a coffee Kavitha had made her. “The way you did the hall for the Christmas concert. Everyone said so.”</p>
<p>Kavitha said she would be happy to help. What she did not say was that she had done the hall for the Christmas concert because no one had asked her to do anything else — not to organize the refreshments or lead the carol singing or sit on the committee — and that arranging the flowers had been the task left over after the other tasks had been distributed among women who had known each other since childhood, women whose grandmothers had known each other’s grandmothers, and that she had taken the leftover task and made it beautiful because making things beautiful was a way of being present without being presumptuous, of contributing without claiming.</p>
<p>The flowers were to be white. Diane wanted white flowers because Jack’s party had a winter theme, even though it was March and the snow was mostly gone except in the ditches and along the north side of the barns where the sun couldn’t reach.</p>
<p>“White tulips,” Kavitha said. “And maybe narcissus. Some branches — pussy willows if I can find them.”</p>
<p>“Whatever you think. You have the eye.”</p>
<p>Kavitha drove to the florist in Exeter. The road was straight and flat and the fields on either side were brown and wet and in the distance a line of bare trees marked a creek that she had never walked to but had looked at from this road a hundred times. She thought about her mother. She thought about calling her sister Ruma in New Jersey, who would be practical and say they should take turns going to Calcutta, and about calling her brother Subhash in Calcutta, who would say Ma was exaggerating, it was not so bad, the doctors were optimistic. Kavitha knew neither of these conversations would help because the problem was not logistical. The problem was that her mother was dying in a city Kavitha could picture in perfect detail — the jasmine in the courtyard, the sound of the pressure cooker at five in the afternoon, the particular shade of evening light that came through the window above the landing — and that she was driving through a flat landscape that would never be home no matter how many years she lived in it.</p>
<p>At the florist she chose tulips and narcissus and a bundle of willow branches that were just beginning to show their silver catkins. The florist, a woman named Trish, wrapped them in brown paper and said, “These are lovely,” and Kavitha thanked her and carried them to the car and sat for a moment in the parking lot with the flowers on the passenger seat and the engine running and the heater blowing.</p>
<p>She could go. That was the thought she let surface, briefly, the way you might open a window in a cold room just to feel the air before closing it again. She could go. Not to Calcutta — that was a different kind of going — but simply away. Down the highway, past Exeter, past London, the landscape opening up or closing in, it didn’t matter, the point was the motion, the not-being-in-the-place-where-she-was.</p>
<p>She had thought this before. Many times. In the early years it had been a sharp thought, vivid and particular — she had imagined specific destinations, had once gone so far as to look up bus schedules to Montreal — but over time it had softened into something more like weather, always present and rarely acknowledged, the way farmers spoke about the wind.</p>
<p>She drove home. She always drove home.</p>
<hr>
<p>The cat was in the yard when she got back, sitting near the garden shed, watching a bird on the fence. It did not run when she got out of the car. She carried the flowers past it and it looked at her with its torn ear tilted slightly, as though considering whether she was worth the effort of fear.</p>
<p>She arranged the flowers on the kitchen table. White tulips in a glass vase, their stems pale green in the water, their petals closed like hands. The narcissus she put in a smaller jar — their scent was strong and sweet and filled the kitchen within minutes. The willow branches she trimmed and set in a tall ceramic pitcher Neil’s mother had given them when they moved. The pitcher was English, cream-coloured with blue flowers painted on it, and Kavitha had always liked it and had always known it was a gift that meant <em>here is a thing from my family; now this is your kitchen too</em>, and that the message was kind but also territorial, a small flag planted on the counter.</p>
<p>She stepped back and looked at what she had made. It was beautiful. She was good at this. She was good at a number of things that did not count in the way that counting usually worked.</p>
<hr>
<p>Neil came home at six. He hung his coat on the hook by the door, the third hook from the left, the one he always used.</p>
<p>“Smells good,” he said. He meant the narcissus. He stood for a moment looking at the flowers.</p>
<p>“They’re for Diane’s party. I’m doing the arrangements tomorrow.”</p>
<p>“Nice of you.”</p>
<p>“She asked.”</p>
<p>He went to wash his hands and Kavitha listened to the water running in the bathroom and then he came back and sat at the table and she poured him a beer and he drank from it and opened the newspaper and she began to prepare dinner. Chicken. Rice. The dal she made from her mother’s recipe, which was not the same as her mother’s dal because the lentils here were different, or the water was different, or her hands were different, something was different, and she had stopped trying to identify what.</p>
<p>“My mother called today,” she said.</p>
<p>“Oh? How is she?”</p>
<p>Kavitha measured the lentils and rinsed them three times and put them on the stove. She added turmeric and salt and a bay leaf.</p>
<p>“She’s not well. The doctors found something in her lungs.”</p>
<p>Neil put the newspaper down. He looked at her. To his credit — and Kavitha kept a kind of credit ledger for Neil, not consciously but instinctively, the way one tracks weather — he looked at her with genuine concern.</p>
<p>“What kind of something?”</p>
<p>“She didn’t say exactly. She said the treatment isn’t going well.”</p>
<p>“Should you go?”</p>
<p>It was the right question. It was the question a good husband asks. Kavitha stirred the dal and watched the turmeric bloom yellow in the water and thought about the distance between a right question and the question she needed, which was not a question at all but an acknowledgment that going meant leaving and leaving meant something different for her than it meant for him, that every departure carried inside it the possibility of not coming back, and that this possibility was not a threat but a door she kept closed out of a discipline she had learned so long ago she could no longer distinguish it from preference.</p>
<p>“Maybe,” she said. “Let me talk to Ruma.”</p>
<p>“Of course. Whatever you need.”</p>
<p>He picked up the newspaper again. She stood at the stove. The dal simmered. Outside, through the window above the sink, the cat sat on the back step in the last of the daylight.</p>
<hr>
<p>In the morning she went to Diane’s house to do the flowers. The house was clean and warm and smelled like baking. Diane had made a cake shaped like a snowman and had covered it in white fondant and was anxious about the nose, which was a candy carrot that kept falling off.</p>
<p>“I keep sticking it back on and it keeps sliding,” Diane said. “Maybe I should just leave it. A noseless snowman. Jack won’t care.”</p>
<p>Kavitha fixed the nose with a toothpick and a dab of icing. Diane laughed and said, “You’re a genius, honestly,” and Kavitha smiled and went to work on the flowers.</p>
<p>She arranged them on the long table in the dining room — the tulips in the center, the narcissus in clusters at either end, the willow branches in the tall pitcher beside the window where the light would catch the catkins. She worked for an hour, moving stems, adjusting heights, stepping back and looking and then stepping forward to make small changes that no one but her would notice but that made the difference between pretty and right.</p>
<p>While she worked, Diane talked. She talked about Jack and about Stuart and about Stuart’s mother Betty who was difficult and about the new family that had moved into the old Perkins place on the Fourth Concession and about the weather and about a show she was watching. Kavitha listened. She was good at listening. She had learned to listen the way she had learned to arrange flowers — as a way of being in a room without taking up too much of it.</p>
<p>But there was a moment — and this was the kind of moment Kavitha would remember years later, long after the flowers had died and the party had been forgotten, the kind of moment that accrues meaning slowly, the way a stain spreads on fabric — when Diane stopped talking and looked at her and said, “Are you all right, Kay? You seem far away.”</p>
<p>And Kavitha looked up from the narcissus she was placing and thought about her mother in Calcutta and about the cat in the yard and about the bus schedules to Montreal she had once looked up and about Neil’s coat on the third hook from the left, and she said, “I’m fine, thank you. Just concentrating.”</p>
<p>Diane nodded and went back to talking about the show and Kavitha went back to the flowers and the moment passed, which is what moments do when you let them.</p>
<hr>
<p>That evening her sister called. Ruma was eight years younger, born in New Jersey, raised there, and spoke Bengali with an accent that made their mother wince. She had a job in pharmaceutical marketing and two children and a husband named Adam who tried.</p>
<p>“She’s not going to tell us how bad it is,” Ruma said. “That’s how she is. She’ll say she’s fine until she’s dead.”</p>
<p>“She won’t say she’s fine. She’ll say we should not worry.”</p>
<p>“Same thing.”</p>
<p>Kavitha sat on the bed in the room she shared with Neil. Neil was downstairs watching hockey. She could hear the television through the floor — the muffled rise and fall of the crowd.</p>
<p>“One of us should go,” Ruma said.</p>
<p>“Yes.”</p>
<p>“Can you go first? I have this launch at work, the timing is — I know that sounds terrible.”</p>
<p>“It doesn’t sound terrible.”</p>
<p>“It does. It sounds terrible. But if you could go first and then I’ll come in April —”</p>
<p>“Ruma. I’ll go.”</p>
<p>There was a pause. Kavitha listened to her sister breathing three hundred miles away and thought about how distance worked differently depending on which direction you measured it. New Jersey to Calcutta was far. Ontario to Calcutta was farther. Not in miles — in something else. In the number of translations required to get from here to there. When Ruma went to Calcutta she went as an American visiting India. When Kavitha went she went as — what? As a woman returning to a place she had left but never entirely left, a place that existed in her hands when she cooked and in her dreams when she dreamed in Bengali and in the shape of her silence when she stood in her kitchen in Nairn and did not say the things she did not say.</p>
<p>“Thank you,” Ruma said.</p>
<p>After they hung up Kavitha went downstairs. The television was loud. She went to the kitchen and stood at the window. The cat was there, on the step, a grey shape in the dark. She opened the door. The cold air came in. The cat looked at her.</p>
<p>She went to the refrigerator and took out a piece of chicken from dinner and put it on a saucer and set the saucer on the step. The cat watched her. She went back inside and closed the door and stood at the window and after a minute the cat moved to the saucer and ate.</p>
<p>Neil came in during a commercial.</p>
<p>“Is the door open? It’s cold in here.”</p>
<p>“I closed it.”</p>
<p>He got a beer from the refrigerator and went back to the living room. Kavitha watched the cat finish the chicken and clean its face with one paw, a gesture so precise and self-contained that she felt something loosen in her chest.</p>
<p>She washed the saucer and put it away.</p>
<hr>
<p>She booked the flight for the following week. Toronto to London to Calcutta, thirty-one hours with the layover. She packed lightly — she still had clothes at her mother’s house, hanging in the wardrobe in her old room, cotton salwar kameez she had worn in her twenties, which might still fit if she had not changed too much, though of course she had changed, everyone changes, and the question was not whether the clothes would fit but whether she would recognize the woman who had last worn them.</p>
<p>The morning she left, Neil drove her to the airport. It was early and the fields were grey with frost and the sun had not come up yet.</p>
<p>“Call me when you land,” he said at the departures door.</p>
<p>“I will.”</p>
<p>He kissed her on the forehead. It was the kiss he always gave her — at airports, after arguments, on ordinary evenings — and she had long ago stopped expecting it to reach the place where she needed to be reached. It was not his fault. It was the kind of understanding that came to you slowly, like the realization that you have been cold for a long time and have only just noticed because someone opened a door.</p>
<p>She went through security and sat at the gate and looked at the other passengers. A young couple leaning against each other, sleeping. A businessman on his phone. An Indian family — mother, father, two children — the children playing a game on a tablet, the mother staring out the window at the tarmac. Kavitha watched the mother. She was young, maybe thirty, wearing a green kurta and gold earrings, and her face had the expression Kavitha recognized from her own mirror: the expression of a woman who is in two places at once and fully in neither.</p>
<hr>
<p>The cat was not there when she got back. She had been gone twelve days. Her mother was dying slowly, with the same quiet competence she had brought to everything — cooking, managing a household on a government clerk’s salary, raising three children who would scatter to three different countries and call on Sundays. She was not afraid, or if she was, she hid it with the skill of a lifetime’s practice. Kavitha sat by her bed and held her hand and they talked about small things — the jasmine, which needed pruning, and the neighbor’s son who had gotten into IIT, and the price of fish, and whether the painter had done a good job on the shutters — and between the small things there were silences that held everything else.</p>
<p>On the third day, her mother said, “You look thin. Are you eating properly?”</p>
<p>“I eat, Ma.”</p>
<p>“That husband of yours. Does he cook?”</p>
<p>“Sometimes.”</p>
<p>“Sometimes.” Her mother said this the way she said most things about Neil — without judgment, exactly, but with a precision that contained its own verdict. She had met Neil once, at the wedding, and had formed an opinion that she never revised and never fully articulated. It lived in the word <em>sometimes</em> and in the way she asked about meals.</p>
<p>On the sixth day, Kavitha walked through the old neighborhood. The tailor’s shop was a phone repair place now. The sweet shop was still there but smaller, or she was larger, or memory had done its usual work of gentle distortion. She bought sandesh and brought it back to her mother, who ate one piece and said it was not as good as it used to be, and Kavitha did not know whether this was true or whether it was the kind of thing dying people say about the world they are leaving — that it has already diminished, that the loss is the world’s, not theirs.</p>
<p>On the plane home she cried, briefly, in the dark somewhere over the Atlantic, and then she stopped and wiped her face and watched a movie she did not follow and ate a meal she did not taste and landed in Toronto and collected her bag and walked to the arrivals hall where Neil was waiting.</p>
<p>“How is she?” he asked in the car.</p>
<p>“She’s dying.”</p>
<p>He reached over and put his hand on her knee. She looked out the window at the highway, the flat land, the bare trees.</p>
<p>When they got home the house was clean. Neil had cleaned it. This was his way of saying something he could not say in words, and Kavitha understood it and was grateful for it and also understood that it was not enough, and that this knowledge — that a clean house and a hand on her knee and a kiss on her forehead were acts of love that did not reach the place where she needed to be reached — was something she would carry quietly, the way she carried everything else.</p>
<p>She put down her bag and went to the kitchen. The flowers were gone — Diane must have come to collect the vases. The counter was bare. The grape bowl was full. She went to the window and looked out.</p>
<p>The cat was there.</p>
<p>It was sitting on the step in the late afternoon sun, and when she opened the door it looked at her with its torn ear and its grey fur and its white paws, and she said, “You came back,” and it said nothing because it was a cat, and she went to the refrigerator for a piece of chicken.</p>
<p>She sat on the step beside it while it ate. The yard was bare. The garden shed needed painting. Beyond the yard, the flat fields stretched to the tree line and beyond the tree line, somewhere, the creek she had never walked to. The air was cold and smelled like mud and coming rain.</p>
<p>She thought about her mother. She thought about the jasmine in the courtyard. She thought about the bus schedules to Montreal and about the wardrobe in Calcutta with her old clothes in it and about Neil’s coat on the third hook and about Diane saying <em>you have the eye</em> and about the woman in the green kurta at the airport and about all the rooms she had stood in, here and there, arranging things — flowers, meals, silences, her face — into something that could pass for a life well-chosen.</p>
<p>The cat finished eating and sat beside her and she did not touch it and it did not leave.</p>
<p>This was enough. This was not enough. Both of these things were true and she held them the way she had always held contradictions — with her hands in her lap and her face composed and the immense, quiet, decades-long work of staying precisely where she was.</p>   </section> <div class="reading-footer" data-astro-cid-r24qxsko> <div class="reading-footer__nav" data-astro-cid-r24qxsko> <a href="/work/arranging-the-white-flowers/" class="reading-footer__back" data-astro-cid-r24qxsko> <svg width="16" height="16" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" aria-hidden="true" data-astro-cid-r24qxsko><path d="M19 12H5" data-astro-cid-r24qxsko></path><path d="M12 19l-7-7 7-7" data-astro-cid-r24qxsko></path></svg>
