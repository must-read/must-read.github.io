<p>Bramble Hopworth was halfway up the ladder, one hand braced against the cottage eave and the other extended toward the bird in what she hoped was a gesture of reasonable authority, when the jackdaw tilted its head and regarded her with the contempt that only a creature with no concept of property can muster for someone who has too much of it.</p>
<p>“That,” Bramble said, “is not a toy. That is a Number Seven Equinox Seal infused with three months of collected moonlight, and if you crack it on a rock like you did the last one, I will be having words with you that neither of us will enjoy.”</p>
<p>The jackdaw picked up the bottle in its beak, hopped two inches to the left, and waited.</p>
<p>Bramble had been a hedgewitch for thirty-one years. She had learned, in that time, that arguing with a jackdaw was not fundamentally different from arguing with most people, except that the jackdaw was more honest about wanting something shiny. She suspected this particular bird liked the way the ward-bottles caught the light, which was fair enough. So did she.</p>
<p>She was composing a further remark — something about the declining quality of avian moral fiber in the valley — when the Listening went wrong.</p>
<p>It wasn’t dramatic. It never was. The Listening was not the sort of magic that announced itself with thunderclaps and columns of light; it was more like the difference between a house where someone is home and a house where no one is. Bramble had carried it since she was twenty-seven, inherited from her aunt Sedge along with the cottage, the bee skeps, and a comprehensive set of opinions about compost.</p>
<p>What she felt now was an absence. A cold spot in the warmth, like pressing your thumb into a bruised apple and feeling the softness beneath the skin.</p>
<p>It was coming from the commons beech.</p>
<p>She climbed down the ladder. The jackdaw, recognizing a strategic opportunity, departed with its prize. Bramble didn’t watch it go. She wiped her hands on her apron — an apron that had started the morning with three poultice stains and a smear of beeswax and had since acquired a fourth — and started walking.</p>
<p>The walk from her cottage to the commons was not far. Past the hen coop, where the Orpingtons were arguing about whatever it is that Orpingtons argue about. Past the herb garden, where the rosemary was putting on its autumn growth and the sage had developed ambitions above its station. Past the stone wall that her aunt Sedge had built forty years ago and that Bramble maintained every spring, not because it needed maintaining but because walls, like most things, did better when someone paid attention to them.</p>
<p>She walked the way hedgewitches walk when something is wrong: not fast, but not about to stop.</p>
<hr>
<p>The commons beech was four hundred years old, give or take a century. Nobody knew exactly, because the sort of person who might have counted its rings would have had to cut it down first, and the sort of person who would cut down the commons beech was the sort of person who would not be welcome in Underfold for very long afterward. It stood at the center of the village green, broad as a barn, its canopy throwing shade across half the commons in summer and dropping enough beech-mast in autumn to feed every pig in the valley.</p>
<p>What it also did — and this was the part that only Bramble and a few others knew about — was anchor the weather ward. The beech was old enough and rooted deep enough that it served as a living wardstone, smoothing the worst of the winter storms, coaxing the spring rains into politeness, keeping the frosts from coming early or staying late. Underfold’s reputation as a gentle valley, a place where the fruit always set and the hay always dried, was not an accident of geography. It was the tree.</p>
<p>And the tree had a Warden.</p>
<p>Bramble knelt at the base of the trunk and pressed both palms flat against the bark. It was like pressing her hands against the chest of something that was breathing wrong — shallow, labored, a rattle in the deep wood that she felt in her own ribs. The heartwood was rotting. Not the ordinary rot that came from fungus and damp and the slow patient business of decay. This was something else. It had teeth.</p>
<p>The blight was eating the bond itself: the connection between the tree and its Warden, the magical symbiosis that had kept both of them alive and the valley mild for four decades. It tasted, through the Listening, like iron and old ash.</p>
<p>She tasted the soil at the base of the trunk, pressing a pinch against her tongue. Sour. Not the honest sourness of acid ground — every hedgewitch worth the name knew their soil by flavor — but a flat, metallic sourness, like licking a nail.</p>
<p>She walked around the trunk to the south side, where the roots humped up out of the earth and formed a natural doorway. Grisle’s set. She’d have to go down.</p>
<p>Bramble was fifty-eight years old and her knees had opinions about crawling into badger burrows, but her knees had opinions about most things and she had long since stopped consulting them. She got down on all fours and went in.</p>
<p>The passage was narrow, earth-walled, thick with the smell of a creature who had lived in one place for a very long time. Root-tendrils brushed her hair. The blight was stronger here, a sick throbbing that transmitted through her palms into the bones of her wrists, her forearms, her shoulders. It settled in her joints the way her own arthritis did in wet weather — a deep grinding wrongness with no single source and no clean edge.</p>
<p>Grisle was curled in the main chamber, a hollow about the size of a hearthstone, lined with dry leaves and tufts of his own shed fur. He had been a magnificent badger once. Bramble remembered him at his prime: dense, powerful, with a stripe so white it seemed to glow in moonlight and a temperament so foul that the village dogs crossed the street to avoid his territory. He had bitten Bramble twice in their first year of acquaintance. She had respected him for it.</p>
<p>Now he was diminished. His fur was patchy, dull where it had been sleek. His breathing came in shallow, wet sounds that Bramble could feel echoing in the Listening like someone tapping on a cracked bell. One dark eye opened as she settled herself in the chamber, and he regarded her with the weary patience of the very ill.</p>
<p>“Hello, old man,” she said.</p>
<p>He closed his eye. A tremor ran through his flank. Through the Listening, she felt what he felt: exhaustion so deep it had become landscape — a grey country where everything was far away and took too much effort to reach.</p>
<p>She sat with him for a long time, her hand resting on his side, feeling his breathing sync with the tree’s slow failing pulse. They had never needed to speak. She was not sure, sitting there, whether that was the bond’s doing or simply what happened when you knew someone long enough — when all the important arguments had been had and all the important silences had been kept.</p>
<p>When she finally crawled out, the afternoon light had gone amber and the shadows under the beech had lengthened. She stood, brushed the earth from her knees, and began the inventory that all hedgewitches conduct in times of crisis: What do I have? What do I know? What can I do?</p>
<p>She set to work.</p>
<p>Over the next week, she tried everything. Comfrey and spiderweb poultices packed into the rotting patches. Strengthening draughts of oak bark and elderflower poured into the root channels. A ward-circle of river stones around the trunk, each one charged with a season’s worth of stored sunlight. Every evening she sat with Grisle and tried to feed the bond from her own Listening, which was like trying to inflate a bellows by breathing into it — technically possible but not, she had to admit, sustainable.</p>
<p>Nothing worked. Or rather, everything worked a little, for a day or two, before the blight ate through whatever she’d done and the cold spot spread another inch.</p>
<hr>
<p>The first frost came three weeks early and killed the runner beans.</p>
<p>This, in Underfold, was the equivalent of a declaration of war. Runner beans were serious business. Within two days, the village council had convened, which in Underfold meant five people sitting on benches in the village hall while Parliament the goat chewed on the minutes of the last meeting. Parliament had been attending council meetings for nine years and had never once been formally appointed; he simply turned up at the first one and no one had successfully removed him since. He voted by headbutt.</p>
<p>“The bread won’t rise,” said Juniper Floss, who was the baker and therefore, by the ancient unspoken hierarchy of village importance, the most essential person present. “Three days running. I’ve tried new yeast, I’ve tried old yeast, I’ve tried the sourdough starter my mother kept alive for forty years. Nothing.”</p>
<p>“My well water tastes of pennies,” said old Fen Ridley.</p>
<p>“My chickens won’t lay,” said Sorrel Blackwood. “Well. They lay, but the shells are thin. You can see right through them. It’s not natural.”</p>
<p>They all looked at Bramble.</p>
<p>This was the part of hedgewitching that no one told you about. You spent decades quietly keeping things running, and you did it so well that everyone forgot it required keeping. And then something went wrong and they looked at you as if you’d personally invented the concept of blight.</p>
<p>“The commons beech is sick,” Bramble said. “The weather ward is failing. I’m working on it.”</p>
<p>“Working on it how?” asked Alderman Poole, who had been elected to his position largely because no one else wanted it and who carried out his duties with the resigned efficiency of a man who has accepted his fate without enjoying it.</p>
<p>“With the tools available to me.”</p>
<p>“And those are?”</p>
<p>“Patience. Stubbornness. A reasonable understanding of soil chemistry.”</p>
<p>Parliament ate the corner of a tax record.</p>
<p>“It’s just,” said Juniper Floss, with the careful diplomacy of someone who did not want to offend the only person who could fix the problem but who also really needed the problem fixed, “the Harvest Fair is in six weeks. And if the bread won’t rise—”</p>
<p>“I know.”</p>
<p>“—and the apples taste of nothing—”</p>
<p>“I <em>know</em>, Juniper.”</p>
<p>There was a silence. Bramble looked at the five faces looking at her. She had kept this village comfortable for longer than some of them had been alive. She had refreshed the wards every equinox, talked the bees through three bad winters, coaxed the creek back into its bed after the flood of ‘09, and once — though no one remembered this — spent four days without sleep holding a containment circle around a patch of wild magic that had bubbled up in Fen Ridley’s turnip field and would have given every root vegetable in the valley legs if she hadn’t.</p>
<p>They didn’t know. Of course they didn’t know. That was the job. You held things together, and if you did it well enough, no one noticed the holding.</p>
<p>“I’ll fix it,” she said, because that was what she always said. The alternative — “I don’t know how” — was not a sentence that hedgewitches were issued.</p>
<p>Parliament headbutted the bench leg on her way out. She chose to interpret this as solidarity.</p>
<hr>
<p>The walk to Hazel Blackthorn’s cottage took the better part of a morning, over the ridge and through two valleys where the weather was already rougher than Underfold’s — not because of any blight, but because those valleys had no beech and no Warden, and their winters came honestly. Bramble felt the difference in her Listening like stepping from a warm room into a cold one: the land here was harder, more itself, unapologetic about its frosts.</p>
<p>It was a useful reminder. Underfold’s gentleness was not the natural state of things.</p>
<p>Hazel Blackthorn lived in a cottage so overgrown with climbing roses that it looked like an argument between architecture and botany that botany was winning. She was a hundred and twelve years old and had largely retired from active witching in favor of her rock garden, which she maintained with a ferocity that suggested the rocks would not dare to be anywhere other than exactly where she put them.</p>
<p>“It’s the bond,” Bramble said, sitting on a stone bench while Hazel repotted a succulent with hands that were mostly knuckle but still precise. “The blight is eating the bond between the tree and its Warden. I’ve tried poultices, strengthening draughts, a ward-circle around the roots. Nothing works.”</p>
<p>“Because you’re treating symptoms,” Hazel said.</p>
<p>“I know that. I’m not stupid.”</p>
<p>“No. Stubborn, which is different and occasionally worse.” Hazel set down the succulent. “The beech is four hundred years old.”</p>
<p>“Approximately.”</p>
<p>“And Grisle has been its Warden for forty.”</p>
<p>“Forty-one in spring.”</p>
<p>“There won’t be a forty-one, Bramble.”</p>
<p>Bramble said nothing. Wind moved through the roses.</p>
<p>“The tree can be saved,” Bramble said. “If I can find the source of the blight, if I can clear it out—”</p>
<p>“The tree is the source. The tree is old. It’s finishing. And the bond that’s kept it going past its time is finishing too, and the blight is what finishing looks like when you refuse to let it happen gracefully.”</p>
<p>Bramble opened her mouth and found she had nothing to put in it.</p>
<p>“You can’t cure what’s finishing,” Hazel said, returning to her succulent. “You can only help what’s beginning.”</p>
<p>“That’s not—”</p>
<p>“You’ve been the mortar so long you’ve forgotten you’re also a brick.” Hazel pressed soil around the succulent’s roots with her thumbs, firmly, without gentleness but with absolute care.</p>
<p>Bramble didn’t answer. She wanted the tree to live, the ward to hold, Grisle to breathe without that terrible rattle. She wanted the runner beans back. She was not, at that particular moment, interested in philosophy.</p>
<p>“There’s a sapling,” Hazel said. “Growing in the old roots. I can feel it from here, if I bother to listen, which I mostly don’t because retirement is supposed to mean something. And there’s a young badger.”</p>
<p>“Grisle’s cub. Yes. I’ve seen her at dusk.”</p>
<p>“So.”</p>
<p>“So what?”</p>
<p>Hazel looked at her. The look contained no pity and no softness and more patience than Bramble deserved, which was worse than either.</p>
<p>“You know what the Passing is,” Hazel said.</p>
<p>“My aunt Sedge described it to me. She never performed it.”</p>
<p>“Because she never had to. You do.” Hazel picked up her watering can. “Go home, Bramble. Sit with your badger. Listen to what he’s telling you instead of what you want him to say.”</p>
<hr>
<p>She went home. She sat with her badger.</p>
<p>She was not ready. She didn’t think Hazel was right — or she did, somewhere underneath the part of her that was still arguing, but the arguing part was louder and more practiced and had been winning for thirty-one years.</p>
<p>Grisle was awake when she crawled into his set that evening, his dark eyes open and clear in a way they hadn’t been for weeks. The Listening between them was wide open, and what came through was not words — badgers do not traffic in words; they have better things to do — but something more fundamental. Memory, carried in sensation.</p>
<p>The taste of earthworms after summer rain, rich and loamy and alive. The sound of children’s feet on the beech’s lowest branch, and the vibration traveling down through the trunk into the roots where he lay. Autumn light falling through the canopy in coins of gold, and the warmth of the bark against his back in his younger years, when leaning was still easy. A winter when three cubs died and the set smelled of grief for months and the tree held him in its roots and said nothing, because trees have no comfort to offer, only presence. The slow green patience of sapwood growing: imperceptible, unstoppable, a movement measured in decades.</p>
<p>Forty years. He had never been thanked. He had never expected thanks. That was not what wardenship was.</p>
<p>And underneath all of it, clear as water: readiness. A tiredness that had earned its rest, and a willingness to set the work down. Not faith that what came after would be enough — he was a badger, not a philosopher — but the simpler thing beneath faith, which is being too tired to hold on and finding that the letting go is not the disaster you expected.</p>
<p>Bramble pressed her face against his fur and breathed him in — earth, leaf mold, the faint sharp musk of a wild creature, the warm animal smell that she had known for thirty years and would not know again.</p>
<p>“All right,” she whispered. “All right, you stubborn old thing. I hear you.”</p>
<hr>
<p>The Passing was not a complicated ritual. Aunt Sedge had described it in three sentences, which was three more than Aunt Sedge usually spent on anything that wasn’t sheep or weather. You sat with the old bond. You opened the Listening as wide as it would go. And you let go.</p>
<p>The letting go was the hard part. Not because it required power or skill but because it required her to stop. To stop holding. To stop maintaining. To stop being the mortar — she was still annoyed at Hazel for that one, which was probably the point.</p>
<p>She sat with Grisle through the night. The old beech creaked above them, its branches moving in a wind that smelled of coming weather — real weather, unmediated, the kind that Underfold hadn’t felt in decades. Through the Listening she could feel the tree’s long, slow exhale, the bond between trunk and Warden thinning like smoke, and it hurt. It hurt in her joints and her chest and the backs of her eyes. Part of it was grief. Part of it she refused to name, because if it was relief she would not forgive herself for it.</p>
<p>She kept her hand on Grisle’s side. His breathing slowed. The rattle faded, not because he was getting better but because he was getting past the need for better. She felt his awareness narrow: the warmth of her hand, the smell of the earth, the deep old root-hold of the tree he had served.</p>
<p>Somewhere past midnight, she felt it: a new warmth in the Listening, faint and directionless. The sapling in the old roots, no taller than her forearm, its green thread of life reaching blindly downward. And above, padding soft-footed across the moonlit commons, a young badger — Grisle’s last cub, bright-eyed, not yet heavy with the years that would come. The cub stopped at the edge of the beech’s canopy and lifted her nose to the air.</p>
<p>Bramble did not know if it would take. She did not know if the sapling was strong enough or the cub was the right cub or if wanting something to work had ever once been sufficient to make it work. She knew that the weather ward would fail. That Underfold would have hard winters and late frosts and bread that sometimes didn’t rise. That she would have to explain to the village council that comfort was not a permanent condition, and Parliament would eat something important, and none of it would be easy.</p>
<p>Grisle’s breathing stopped sometime before dawn. It didn’t stop all at once. It slowed, and thinned, and became indistinguishable from the sound of the wind in the branches, and by the time Bramble realized it had ended, it had been over for a while. She sat with him in the silence and felt the last of the old bond dissolve — not snapping, not breaking, but releasing, the way a leaf releases from a branch when the season turns.</p>
<p>She crawled out of the set into grey morning light. The commons was wet with dew. The old beech stood as it had always stood, massive and patient, but she could see now the bare patches in the canopy, the branch-ends that had stopped reaching. It would stand for years yet. Beeches were stubborn that way.</p>
<p>The young badger was sitting on the commons, watching her.</p>
<p>She was smaller than Grisle had been, with a stripe that was more cream than white and ears that seemed slightly too large for her head. She watched Bramble with an expression that was either recognition or simple curiosity about why a middle-aged woman was crawling out of a hole in the ground at dawn, which, to be fair, was a reasonable thing to be curious about.</p>
<p>Bramble sat down on the wet grass. Her knees protested. Her back protested. She was too tired to argue with either of them.</p>
<p>The young badger walked over, sniffed her hand, and settled against her knee. She was warm. Her fur was coarse and dense and smelled of nothing but herself.</p>
<p>Through the Listening, faint as a heartbeat heard through a wall, the new bond pulsed. Once. Twice. Then nothing for a long time, and then once more.</p>
<p>Bramble closed her eyes. She had a ward to rebuild, a village to disappoint, a sapling to tend, and a badger who did not know her yet. Behind her, in the set, the old familiar weight of Grisle’s absence. Ahead of her, a great deal of work that she did not know how to do.</p>
<p>The badger yawned against her knee, enormous and unconcerned.</p>
<p>Bramble got up. Her knees had more to say about it, but she had never been a good listener — not in the ordinary sense, anyway.</p>   </section> <div class="reading-footer" data-astro-cid-r24qxsko> <div class="reading-footer__nav" data-astro-cid-r24qxsko> <a href="/work/hedgewitching-for-beginners/" class="reading-footer__back" data-astro-cid-r24qxsko> <svg width="16" height="16" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" aria-hidden="true" data-astro-cid-r24qxsko><path d="M19 12H5" data-astro-cid-r24qxsko></path><path d="M12 19l-7-7 7-7" data-astro-cid-r24qxsko></path></svg>
