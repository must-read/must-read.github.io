Seventeen cardboard boxes, taped shut with packing tape gone yellow and brittle, stacked on a metal cart in the receiving bay of the Biblioteca Nacional. No return address. A handwritten label on the top box read, in a script that trembled at the ascenders: <em>Para la Sección de Colecciones Especiales. Donación del Patrimonio Estrada-Villalba.</em></p>
<p>I was twenty-six years old and I had been working at the library for eleven months. My title was Archival Assistant, Grade II, which meant I catalogued what no one else wanted to catalogue — the overflow, the unclaimed, the boxes that sat in storage until someone with enough patience and a high enough tolerance for dust agreed to open them. The library sits on top of a hill in Recoleta like a concrete prophecy of the 1970s, brutalist and massive, its windows narrow as the slits in a fortress wall. Below it, invisible from the reading rooms, the old foundations of the Penitentiary descend into clay. When it rained, water came up through the basement floors. On dry days the archive rooms smelled of binding glue and mildew and, faintly, something mineral, as though the building itself were sweating stone.</p>
<p>My supervisor, Albarracín, told me the Estrada-Villalba boxes had no accompanying documentation. No deed of gift. No provenance record. Just the boxes, left at the loading dock by a delivery service whose receipt listed a sender address in Belgrano that, when I looked it up, turned out to be a parking garage.</p>
<p>“Catalogue them or don’t,” Albarracín said. He was a thin man who wore the same brown cardigan every day regardless of the season and who had survived four reorganizations of the library’s hierarchy by making himself essential to the heating system. “Nobody’s going to ask about them.”</p>
<p>He was wrong about that. But I did not know it yet, standing in the receiving bay with the fluorescent lights buzzing overhead and the smell of old cardboard rising from the cart, the same way you do not know, when you open a door in a building you have passed a thousand times, that the room behind it has been waiting for you specifically, and for a long time.</p>
<hr>
<p>I opened the first box on a Thursday evening after most of the staff had gone home. The reading room on the second floor was empty except for a doctoral student who had fallen asleep over a microfilm reader, his cheek pressed against the glass like a boy at a window. The fluorescent light above my desk had a frequency that made my fillings ache. Outside, a colectivo ground its gears on Avenida del Libertador and the sound rose through the narrow windows like something trying to get in.</p>
<p>The books inside were old. Not rare-old — not incunabula, not hand-illuminated manuscripts — but the kind of old that accumulates in the houses of people who read without system or discrimination. Clothbound novels from the 1940s published by Sudamericana and Losada. A water-damaged copy of <em>Adán Buenosayres</em> with annotations in the margins. Three volumes of an encyclopedia of Argentine flora, 1953 edition, the color plates foxed but intact. Poetry chapbooks with the spines cracked from rereading. A book of household remedies from 1938 whose pages smelled of camphor even through the plastic bag someone had sealed it in.</p>
<p>I catalogued. I weighed each volume, measured its dimensions, noted its condition. I gave each an accession number and entered it into the database. This was the work I was trained for, the naming of things — their physical properties, their provenance when determinable, their place in the great shelving order of human knowledge. I was good at it in the way that people are good at things that suit their particular variety of loneliness.</p>
<p>The work took several evenings. The boxes were packed tightly and without order, as though someone had filled them in a hurry or in the dark, grabbing volumes from shelves the way you grab clothes when you are leaving a place and do not know if you are coming back. Some books had been packed spine-up, their pages fanning open under the weight of the volumes above them, so that when I lifted them out they fell apart in my hands like birds that had forgotten how to close their wings. I repaired what I could with Japanese tissue and wheat paste, the way the conservation manual prescribed, and I labeled what I could not repair and set it aside in the discard pile, and I tried not to think about what it meant that the family name on the boxes was the name I had been born with.</p>
<p>Estrada-Villalba. My mother’s maiden name, which was my grandmother’s married name, which was the name on the house that burned.</p>
<p>It was in the seventh box that I found the diary.</p>
<p>It was a hardcover notebook, A5, bound in dark green cloth that had gone nearly black along the spine from handling. No title on the cover. The pages were lined, the handwriting small and angular and immediately, violently familiar, because I had seen it before — on recipe cards in my mother’s kitchen drawer, on the backs of photographs, on the single letter that had survived the fire and that my mother kept in a plastic sleeve in the bottom drawer of her nightstand and that I had read so many times as a child that I could recite its final line from memory: <em>Tell Inés I am keeping the books safe. The books are all that matters now.</em></p>
<p>The diary belonged to my grandmother. Amelia Estrada de Villalba. Dead before I was born. Dead, according to my mother, in the fire that destroyed the house on Calle Arribeños in 1977.</p>
<p>My hands were shaking. The fluorescent light hummed. The doctoral student snored softly against his microfilm reader. I turned the first page.</p>
<hr>
<p>I should tell you about the house, because you will need to understand it in order to understand what the diary became.</p>
<p>My mother spoke of it rarely and only in fragments, the way you speak of a place that hurt you. A two-story casa chorizo in Belgrano, one of those long, narrow houses built in the Italian style in the 1890s, room opening onto room in a sequence that ran from the street-facing sala through the dining room and bedrooms to the kitchen and the patio at the back. Tile floors, fifteen-foot ceilings, a jacaranda in the courtyard whose roots had cracked the cistern. The Estrada family had lived there since 1923. Three generations of women who read.</p>
<p>My great-grandmother Josefina had the library built — an addition at the back, past the kitchen, a room with floor-to-ceiling shelves and a glass ceiling that turned the light green in summer when the jacaranda was in leaf. My grandmother Amelia inherited the house and the library in 1962 and spent the next fifteen years filling it, volume by volume, with a collection that — if my mother’s memory was accurate — numbered somewhere above four thousand books.</p>
<p>The house burned in August 1977. My grandmother was inside. My mother, who was seventeen and had been staying with an aunt in Flores, was told it was an electrical fire. She was told this by a policeman who came to the aunt’s door at six in the morning, and she believed it for the same reason everyone believed everything the police told them in 1977, which is that the alternative to believing was a kind of knowledge that could kill you.</p>
<p>I grew up with the fire the way other children grew up with a family dog — it was simply there, part of the household. My mother did not speak of it, but its presence shaped everything: the way she refused to light candles, the way she flinched at the smell of smoke from a neighbour’s asado, the way she kept no library of her own. We had perhaps thirty books in the apartment in Almagro where I spent my childhood — a few paperback novels, some school textbooks, a Bible my mother never opened. I understood from a young age that the absence of books in our home was not indifference but grief. That the empty shelves were a scar the same way the silence around my grandmother’s name was a scar.</p>
<hr>
<p>The diary covered roughly eighteen months, from January 1976 to July 1977. The entries were irregular — sometimes daily, sometimes with weeks between them. My grandmother wrote about the weather, the price of bread, a leaking pipe in the upstairs bathroom, a stray cat that had taken up residence in the courtyard and that she fed scraps of milanesa. She wrote about what she was reading. She wrote long passages about specific books — their bindings, their endpapers, the annotations left by previous owners — with a tenderness that I recognized, because I had inherited it, this specific affliction of caring too much about the physical fact of a book.</p>
<p>But there were other entries. Entries where the handwriting changed — grew smaller, more cramped, pressed harder into the page as though she were trying to push the words through the paper and into the table beneath.</p>
<p><em>March 14, 1976.</em> Three days after the coup. <em>V. came today with two boxes. I put them in the back, behind the encyclopedias. He said not to read them. I read them. They are from the collection of Dr. R—, who is no longer at the university. The spines are unmarked. Inside, they are not what they appear to be.</em></p>
<p><em>April 2, 1976. Another box from V. These books smell of a house I have never been inside, but I know whose house it was, because V.’s hands were shaking when he brought them and he would not come past the front door. I catalogued them with the others. I am keeping a separate ledger.</em></p>
<p><em>June 19, 1976. There are now forty-seven books in the back room that do not exist. What I mean is: they are not listed in any catalogue, any bibliography, any publisher’s record. They are real — I can hold them, I can read them — but they have no provenance. They came from houses where people lived who no longer live anywhere. I am the only record that these books exist.</em></p>
<p>I read that last sentence three times, sitting alone in the empty reading room of the Biblioteca Nacional, and I understood — the way you understand a thing that your body has always known but your mind refused to name — that my grandmother had been hiding books. Not her own books. Books that had been taken from the homes of people who had been taken from their homes. Books salvaged from the libraries of the disappeared.</p>
<p>You have to understand what that word means. <em>Desaparecidos.</em> It does not mean dead. Dead people have graves and dates and certificates. Dead people have a place in the civil registry. <em>Desaparecidos</em> means the state reached into a life and removed it so completely that even the proof of its having existed was consumed. The homes were raided. The papers were burned. The names were struck from lists. And in those homes there were shelves, and on those shelves there were books, and the books bore the names of their owners on the flyleaves, and the books, too, were supposed to disappear. My grandmother had made sure they didn’t.</p>
<hr>
<p>I went back to the boxes. I went through them systematically, the way Albarracín had taught me, the way the library’s procedural manual demanded — but I was no longer looking for publication dates and binding conditions. I was looking for the books that did not exist.</p>
<p>I found them. Not forty-seven — the donation had been culled, or scattered, or partially lost in the decades since the fire — but nineteen volumes that matched no entry in any database I could access. They had ISBNs that resolved to nothing. Publisher imprints that had never been registered. Authors whose names, when I searched them, returned only absence — no birth records, no death records, no obituaries, no university appointments, no newspaper mentions. They were books by people who, according to every official system of documentation, had never been.</p>
<p>The books themselves were real. They had weight and texture and the particular smell of old adhesive and foxed paper that is, for those of us who have spent our lives in archives, the smell of time itself. One was a novel — or appeared to be — set in a house in Belgrano, a casa chorizo with a jacaranda in the courtyard, in which a woman spent her days cataloguing a library of books that referenced other books that did not exist. The woman’s name was Josefina.</p>
<p>My great-grandmother’s name.</p>
<p>I put the book down. I picked it up again. I read the first chapter. The prose was dense and recursive, folding back on itself the way certain streets in Buenos Aires fold back — you walk down Pasaje Enrique Santos Discépolo expecting to reach Corrientes and instead you arrive at a corner you’ve already passed, and the city rearranges itself behind you like a sentence being revised. In the novel, Josefina discovers that the books in her library are writing themselves. Not generating new text — altering existing text. Passages she had read and underlined now said different things. Names shifted. Dates migrated across pages. A character who had died in chapter three was alive in chapter seven, and the prose treated this not as resurrection but as though death had never occurred — as though the narrative had simply refused to accept the disappearance.</p>
<hr>
<p>I spent three weeks reading the nineteen books. I read them in the archive room after hours, with the door closed and the ventilation system clicking its slow mechanical breath above me. I read them the way my grandmother’s diary described her reading them — with a growing sense that the act of reading was itself a form of excavation, that each page I turned was a layer of sediment removed from something that had been deliberately buried.</p>
<p>The books referenced each other. Not overtly — not with footnotes or citations — but through recurring names, recurring streets, recurring houses. A woman named Estrada appeared in seven of the nineteen volumes. Sometimes she was young, sometimes old. In one, she was a piano teacher in Flores. In another, a typist at the Ministry of Education. In a third, she was dead, but her name appeared on a library card tucked into the back of a book that another character was reading — a character who lived in a house in Belgrano with a glass-ceilinged room at the back.</p>
<p>The books were a library about a library. They were a catalogue of a world that had been burned, and they had survived the burning, and now they sat in the basement of the Biblioteca Nacional and referenced each other with the insistence of ghosts who refuse to stop speaking simply because no one is listening.</p>
<p>I called my mother. I did not tell her about the diary or the books. I asked her, carefully, as though the question were casual, whether anyone else in the family had ever donated books to a library. She was quiet for a long time. I could hear the television in her apartment in Almagro, the six o’clock news, a reporter talking about a water main break in Barracas.</p>
<p>“Your grandmother had a friend,” she said finally. “Vicente. He was a teacher. He used to bring boxes to the house — I remember the boxes, because they came at night and she would make me go upstairs. After the fire I never saw him again. I assumed he was —” She stopped. In my mother’s vocabulary, there were sentences that ended not with periods but with the specific silence that meant <em>taken.</em> She did not finish the sentence. She did not need to.</p>
<p>I went to Calle Arribeños. I took the Línea D to José Hernández and walked four blocks north in the grey late-autumn light, past the shops on Juramento, past the old boys’ school, into the residential streets where the houses still had the scale of the 1890s — two stories, narrow facades, iron balconies going green with oxidation. The house at the address my mother had given me — the address she had never returned to — was gone. In its place was a parking structure. Three levels of poured concrete with a ramp that spiraled down into fluorescent darkness. The same parking garage that had been listed as the sender address on the donation.</p>
<p>I stood on the sidewalk and counted the houses on either side. The neighbours had not changed. The building to the left was a casa chorizo with blue shutters; the one to the right had a pharmacy on the ground floor. Between them, where my grandmother’s house had stood, where the jacaranda had grown, where four thousand books had burned in August 1977, there was a concrete ramp descending into the earth, and cars went in and cars came out, and no one paused or looked twice at the place where the entrance was, because it had been there long enough that the city had absorbed it the way a body absorbs a scar.</p>
<p>I walked down the ramp. I don’t know why. The fluorescent tubes overhead were the same greenish-white as the ones in the archive room, and the concrete walls were unpainted, and the air smelled of exhaust and damp and, underneath it, something older — ash, maybe, or the mineral tang of burned stone. The ramp spiraled down two levels. At the bottom, in the last parking bay against the far wall, there was a jacaranda seedling growing through a crack in the concrete floor. It was perhaps thirty centimeters tall. Its leaves were the small, compound, feathered leaves of a young tree, and it was growing in a place where no sunlight reached, and it was alive.</p>
<p>I stood there for a long time. A car alarm went off on the street above. Someone honked. The city continued its indifferent roar. I climbed back up into the grey afternoon light and took the subte home and did not tell anyone what I had seen, because what I had seen was either a coincidence or an impossibility, and I did not yet know which of those was worse.</p>
<hr>
<p>The last entry in my grandmother’s diary was dated July 30, 1977. Nine days before the fire.</p>
<p><em>The separate ledger is complete. Forty-seven books catalogued. I have listed them by the names of the people they belonged to, not by title or author, because the books are not the point. The books are proof. Proof that these people existed, that they owned things, that they sat in chairs and turned pages and wrote their names on flyleaves and left coffee rings on covers and dog-eared the passages that mattered to them. A library is a census of the living. When they burn the libraries they are not burning paper. They are burning the evidence that anyone was ever here.</em></p>
<p><em>I have made copies of the ledger. One is in the house. One is in the books themselves — I have written the names into the margins, into the endpapers, into the spaces between the lines, so that if any single book survives, it carries the names with it. You cannot burn a name out of a book if the name has been written into every book.</em></p>
<p><em>If you are reading this, know that I did not leave. I stayed with the books because someone had to stay with the books, because the books are people, and you do not leave people alone in a house that is about to burn.</em></p>
<p>I closed the diary. The archive room was silent except for the ventilation and, distantly, the sound of Avenida del Libertador — the buses, the taxis, the eight lanes of traffic that run along the base of the hill on which the library stands. It was nine o’clock at night. The building was empty. I was alone in a room full of books that belonged to people who had been erased, and the books were still here, and my grandmother was not, and the distance between those two facts was the entire history of my country.</p>
<hr>
<p>I checked the margins.</p>
<p>I went back to the nineteen books and I looked at the margins, the endpapers, the spaces between lines, the blank pages at the front and back, and I found them — the names. Written in pencil so faint it was nearly invisible, in my grandmother’s handwriting, small and angular and certain. Names I did not recognize: Peralta, Ledesma, Irigoyen, Bustamante, Oribe. Names with dates beside them. Names with addresses. Names that, when I searched the records of the Comisión Nacional sobre la Desaparición de Personas, appeared on the lists. Every one. All of them.</p>
<p>My grandmother had written the names of the disappeared into the books of the disappeared, and the books had carried the names through the fire and through forty-seven years of storage and through the institutional indifference of a library system that would have pulped them for shelf space if anyone had ever bothered to check.</p>
<p>I sat with this knowledge the way you sit with a burn. Not the immediate white shock of contact but the slow, deep ache that comes after, the knowledge that the skin has been permanently changed.</p>
<hr>
<p>There is one more thing. The novel I mentioned — the one about Josefina in the casa chorizo, cataloguing books that rewrote themselves. I finished it on a Saturday afternoon in the archive room, reading by the light that came through the one narrow window, and when I reached the final chapter I found that the text had changed.</p>
<p>Not metaphorically. Not in the sense that rereading reveals new meanings. The words on the page were different from the words I had read two weeks earlier. I know this because I had photographed every page with my phone when I first read it — a habit of archivists, the compulsion to make copies — and when I compared the photographs to the physical pages, the final chapter no longer matched.</p>
<p>In the version I had photographed, the novel ended with Josefina sealing her library and walking out of the house. In the version on the page — the version that existed now, that was real and physical and printed on paper I could touch — the novel ended with Josefina’s granddaughter entering the library for the first time. The granddaughter’s name was Inés.</p>
<p>My name.</p>
<p>The text described the archive room of the Biblioteca Nacional. It described the fluorescent light, the narrow windows, the ventilation system’s mechanical breath. It described a woman of twenty-six with her grandmother’s handwriting reading a book that was reading her back.</p>
<p>I have not shown this to anyone. I have not told Albarracín. I have not told my mother. I have continued cataloguing the nineteen books, entering them into the system with the careful, neutral descriptions that the procedural manual requires — dimensions, binding type, condition, subject classification. I have not entered the names in the margins. I have not entered the fact that the text changes. I have not entered the fact that when I arrive each morning, the books are not in the order I left them in, that they have rearranged themselves on the shelf during the night the way my grandmother described, that the novel about Josefina now contains chapters that were not there yesterday, chapters about a woman named Amelia who hides books during a war, chapters about a woman named Inés who finds them after.</p>
<p>The catalogue grows. I record what I can. I know that a catalogue is a form of memory, and that memory is a form of resistance, and that my grandmother understood this before I was born. The books are still writing themselves. The names in the margins have not faded. The dead are still here, pressed between pages, shelved in the dark, waiting to be read.</p>
<p>I stay late. I lock the archive room. I open a book. I begin.</p>   </section> <div class="reading-footer" data-astro-cid-r24qxsko> <div class="reading-footer__nav" data-astro-cid-r24qxsko> <a href="/work/the-catalogue-of-burned-things/" class="reading-footer__back" data-astro-cid-r24qxsko> <svg width="16" height="16" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" aria-hidden="true" data-astro-cid-r24qxsko><path d="M19 12H5" data-astro-cid-r24qxsko></path><path d="M12 19l-7-7 7-7" data-astro-cid-r24qxsko></path></svg>
