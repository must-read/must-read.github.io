I said I did but it was terrible. He drank it anyway, which told me he was going in.</p>
<p>He had a Sharps rifle in a leather scabbard and a Walker Colt on his hip that looked like it hadn’t been fired since the Grant administration. His horse was a line-back dun that needed water. I gave it water. The man didn’t ask me my name. That was fine.</p>
<p>I had beans on the stove. He didn’t ask about those either.</p>
<p>The goat watched him the whole time. She watches everyone. That’s what she’s for.</p>
<hr>
<p>Gage Ellender sat on the bench outside the woman’s shack and drank the coffee. It was terrible. Chicory and something burnt, maybe mesquite root. He drank it because he’d been riding since before dawn and his canteen had gone warm two hours ago and you don’t refuse what’s offered at the edge of nowhere.</p>
<p>The woman’s place was a plank-and-canvas structure built into a rockfall at the mouth of the canyon. She had a cookfire, a rain barrel, a sleeping pallet visible through the open door, and a goat tied to a stake twenty yards out, where the flat ground met the canyon’s throat. The goat stood facing the canyon and did not move. It didn’t graze. It didn’t pull at the rope. It stood the way a dog stands when it’s been told to stay. Gage had seen goats all his life and none of them had ever stood like that. Goats are restless animals. This one was still the way a sentry is still.</p>
<p>“Halloran,” Gage said. “He’s in there.”</p>
<p>“He was,” the woman said.</p>
<p>“How long?”</p>
<p>“Three weeks yesterday. He had four men with him. Mules, provisions, the whole operation. He said he had a mining claim.”</p>
<p>“He does. He also has a debt. Two hundred dollars to the family of a man who died in one of his shafts. Roof fall. Halloran wouldn’t shore his timbers.”</p>
<p>The woman looked at the canyon. “People come here for different reasons,” she said.</p>
<p>“I’m here for two hundred dollars.”</p>
<p>“I know what you’re here for.”</p>
<p>Gage finished the coffee and set the cup on the bench. The cup was tin and the bench was pine and both were real things he could put his hands on.</p>
<p>“You live out here alone,” he said.</p>
<p>“I live out here,” she said.</p>
<p>“The lawyer in Tucson said Halloran had supplies for a month. Said he was assaying the canyon for silver.”</p>
<p>“There’s no silver in there.”</p>
<p>“What is in there?”</p>
<p>The woman picked up his cup and walked toward her stove. “You’ll see,” she said.</p>
<p>He checked the loads in the Sharps and the action on the Colt and he looked at the canyon. He’d been a contract scout for the Army when Crook went after Geronimo, and before that he’d ridden shotgun on the Tucson stage for two years. He knew how to read terrain — what a canyon could hide, where a man could shoot from, how sound moved in enclosed rock. He looked at La Boca the way he looked at any unfamiliar ground, measuring angle and distance and cover.</p>
<p>The canyon walls were black. Not shadow-black, not the black of basalt or iron ore. A wet black, like the rock had been dipped in something and not allowed to dry. He knew what desert varnish looked like — he’d seen it on cliffs in the Sonoran, the manganese patina that took centuries to form. This was thicker than that. This was wrong.</p>
<p>“When’s the last time you saw anyone come out?” he said.</p>
<p>“I don’t keep count of what comes out,” the woman said.</p>
<p>Gage looked at the goat. The goat looked at the canyon. The woman went inside and he could hear her moving a pot on the stove.</p>
<p>He picked up the rifle and walked in.</p>
<hr>
<p>He entered as all men enter here — upright, armed, certain of the cardinal directions.</p>
<p>The canyon received him the way a throat receives a swallowed stone: with neither reluctance nor welcome, merely the peristaltic patience of a passage that has swallowed before and will swallow again. The walls rose on either side, sixty feet, eighty, their surfaces slicked with the black manganese integument that is the canyon’s oldest garment — a varnish laid down across millennia by microbial congregations whose purposes remain opaque to the sciences that have tried, with their petri dishes and their mass spectrometers, to read them. The varnish is a living text. It accrues. It does not explain itself.</p>
<p>His boots struck the canyon floor and the sound returned wrong — not the clean report of leather on stone but a muffled, fibrous sound, as if the ground had grown a skin between his last step and this one. The light, too, had changed its terms: at the canyon’s mouth the sun had fallen from the west, as February demanded, but thirty yards in the illumination seemed sourceless, directionless, the amber light of a room whose windows have been papered over with something translucent and faintly sweet.</p>
<p>He did not notice the sweetness yet. That would come later, when the air thickened to the consistency of warm honey and his lungs began their slow negotiation with a medium that was no longer, strictly speaking, air.</p>
<p>But his hand knew. His left hand, the one that did not hold the rifle, had already begun to open — the fingers uncurling from the fist he hadn’t known he was making — and the palm, turned upward, received the canyon’s first communication: a warmth that was not the warmth of sun on skin but the warmth of skin on skin, as if the air itself had pressed a mouth to his hand and breathed.</p>
<hr>
<p>He went in around noon. I could tell the time because the shadow of the east wall crossed the goat’s stake at midday and it had just passed.</p>
<p>I brought the goat in early that day. I don’t know why. I usually leave her out until dusk. She came without pulling. She knows what the canyon sounds like when it’s working. I don’t mean noise. I mean the quality of the silence changes, the way a room feels different when someone is listening on the other side of a wall.</p>
<p>I’ve been here eleven years. Before me there was a prospector who kept a camp at the mouth for two seasons and then one morning walked in and didn’t walk out. Before him I don’t know. The canyon doesn’t keep records in any language I can read.</p>
<p>I made more coffee because I thought he’d be back soon. Most of them come back soon. The ones who don’t — I stop thinking about them. That’s not cruelty. That’s housekeeping.</p>
<hr>
<p>The camp was a quarter mile in. Gage found it by the smell — cold ash and canvas and the sweet rot of provisions left too long in the heat. Two wall tents still staked and guyed. A fire pit with a ring of stones. Canned goods stacked on a folding table, some of them blown. Bedrolls in the tents, still laid out. Saddlebags hung from a rope strung between two stakes.</p>
<p>No horses. No mules. No bodies. No blood.</p>
<p>On a flat rock near the fire pit, arranged in a neat stack, was $200. He counted it without touching it — paper on the bottom, coins on top, the exact amount the lawyer in Tucson had written on the collection order. Gage had the order in his shirt pocket. He’d carried it for three days from Tucson and the paper had softened with his sweat until it felt like cloth.</p>
<p>He didn’t touch the money. The money being there, stacked like that, was a problem. A man who won’t pay his debts doesn’t leave the exact amount sitting on a rock. Someone had put it there. Maybe Halloran. Maybe one of his men. Maybe nobody. And the amount was exact — not approximately right, not close enough, but $200 to the cent, as if whoever stacked it had read the collection order in Gage’s pocket.</p>
<p>He walked through the camp. The tents smelled of mildew and something else, something sweet he couldn’t place. The saddlebags held the usual — tobacco, hardtack, a flask of whiskey still half full. Personal items: a pocket watch stopped at 2:14, a tintype of a woman in a high collar, three letters tied with string that Gage did not read. The gear of men who expected to come back for it.</p>
<p>He looked at the canyon walls. The varnish was thicker here, built up in ridges and whorls like the grain of dark wood. In the places where the walls narrowed, the varnish from opposite sides nearly met, leaving a channel of air between them no wider than his shoulders.</p>
<p>He went deeper.</p>
<hr>
<p>The man he found was sitting with his back to the east wall, fifty yards past the camp, in a section where the canyon floor had narrowed to a path. The man’s legs were straight in front of him and his hands were flat on the ground beside his hips and his eyes were open.</p>
<p>Gage saw the man’s boots first. Good boots, barely worn. Then the trousers, canvas, and the cotton shirt with the sleeves rolled to the elbows. The man’s forearms were the color of the wall behind him. Not near the color — the color. The same wet black, the same mineral sheen, as if someone had painted him from the elbows down or he’d dipped his arms in something and it hadn’t come off.</p>
<p>The man was breathing. His chest moved. His eyes tracked Gage as Gage approached, and the eyes were normal — brown, bloodshot, human.</p>
<p>“Where’s Halloran?” Gage said.</p>
<p>The man smiled. His teeth were very white against the black of his face, which had begun to darken too, the jaw and cheeks going the color of old iron.</p>
<p>“He paid,” the man said.</p>
<p>“Paid who?”</p>
<p>The man didn’t answer that. He looked at Gage the way you look at someone who’s asked a question so wrong that answering it would take longer than the answer is worth.</p>
<p>“You can still walk,” Gage said. “Your legs look all right. Come on.”</p>
<p>“I’m comfortable,” the man said.</p>
<p>“You’re sitting against a rock wall in a box canyon with no water and your arms look like they’ve been dipped in tar.”</p>
<p>“I’m comfortable,” the man said again, and this time his voice had something in it that Gage recognized from a long time ago — the voice of a man at a field hospital who’s been given enough morphine to stop asking questions. Not happy. Past happy. Done.</p>
<p>Gage left him there. There was nothing else to do with him.</p>
<hr>
<p>His epidermis had entered into a correspondence with the mineral substrate — a slow, cellular calligraphy in which the ink was manganese and the page was the borderland between animal tissue and geological indifference. The negotiation had concluded in the substrate’s favor, as it always concludes, as it concluded for the four others who came with their employer and their mule train and their blasting powder and their confidence that the earth is transactional: that you put a hole in it and it gives you what’s inside and the exchange is clean.</p>
<p>The exchange is never clean.</p>
<p>The man’s smile was the residue of a surrender so complete that the muscles required for other expressions had been released from service. His arms had simply stopped insisting on the distinction between themselves and what surrounded them. The varnish had accepted them as it accepts all surfaces given sufficient time, coating them in its slow black accumulation, and they had accepted the varnish, and the acceptance was, from the inside, indistinguishable from relief.</p>
<p>His teeth remained his own. Teeth are honest — calcium phosphate arranged in the body’s most durable confession of appetite — and his appetite had been the last thing to quiet. He had wanted gold. Then he had wanted water. Then air. Then nothing. The teeth survived as monument to the progression.</p>
<hr>
<p>The next stretch of canyon was narrow enough that Gage turned sideways to pass through. The walls pressed close and the varnish was wet on both sides and when his shirt brushed the rock the fabric came away dark and the dark didn’t wipe off. He thought about turning back. He thought about it the way a man thinks about quitting a job he hates — briefly, without conviction, the thought arriving and departing in the same breath because the alternative is worse. The alternative was telling the lawyer in Tucson that the money was sitting on a rock in a canyon and he hadn’t picked it up because the rock felt wrong. He couldn’t say that. He didn’t have the words for it and even if he did, the words wouldn’t sound like anything a man like him would say.</p>
<p>His breathing was different now. He noticed it the way you notice your tongue is in your mouth — a fact that, once observed, becomes impossible to ignore. Each breath took longer. Each breath tasted of iron and sweetness, like licking a penny coated in honey. His hands were warm. Both hands, even the one holding the rifle, though the rifle’s barrel should have been cold in the canyon’s shade.</p>
<p>He kept walking. The canyon turned once to the left and the floor dropped two feet and he lowered himself down carefully, one hand on the wet wall to steady himself. The varnish under his palm was warm. Not sun-warm. Body-warm. He pulled his hand back and wiped it on his trousers and the dark stain stayed on his skin. He looked at it and kept walking. The canyon straightened and ahead of him was the end.</p>
<p>The dead end was a wall. Black varnish, floor to sky, unbroken. It looked like a door — it had a door’s proportions, taller than wide, the surface featureless and absolute. The varnish here was so thick it seemed to move, a slow rolling motion just under the surface, like something alive beneath a sheet of black water.</p>
<p>Gage stopped. He was thirty feet from the wall.</p>
<p>His left hand opened. He didn’t tell it to. The fingers spread and the palm turned outward and the rifle, the Sharps he’d carried for eleven years and cleaned every Sunday and trusted more than he trusted any living person, slid from his grip and clattered on the stone floor and he watched it fall the way you watch something happen to someone else.</p>
<p>He took a step toward the wall.</p>
<hr>
<p>The canyon knew him. It had begun to know him at the mouth — the particular chemistry of his sweat, the cadence of his heartbeat, the specific gravity of his grief, which was considerable and which he carried in the architecture of his silence the way a house carries its foundation: invisibly, structurally, the thing upon which everything else rests.</p>
<p>Gage Ellender had lost his wife six years before to a fever that took her in four days, and when she died he had been sitting at her bedside and he had said “All right” and stood and walked out and never spoke of her again. Not to his friends. Not to himself. He had sealed the wound with function — mornings converted into tasks, silences into discipline — and the seal had held so well he had mistaken it for healing.</p>
<p>The canyon knew this because grief, if left long enough, mineralizes. It deposits itself in strata the way the varnish lays itself down on the rock face, one imperceptible layer per year, until the accumulation becomes a surface, and the surface becomes indistinguishable from the thing it covers. His grief had become his surface. Six years of it.</p>
<p>The wall showed him his wife.</p>
<p>Not a phantom, not a visitation, not the translucent specter of campfire stories and dime novels. A face in the varnish — the way a face appears in the grain of wood or the stain on a ceiling, except that this face was exact. Her jaw. The way her hair fell. The particular asymmetry of her mouth that he had loved and then refused to remember and that now, in the black mineral surface of the canyon’s deepest wall, was as precise as a daguerreotype.</p>
<p>The canyon did not speak. The canyon has never spoken, in any language the ear can register, though the body hears it — through the soles of the feet, through the open palm, through the slow dilation of the lungs as they accept a medium that is no longer air but something older and more patient. What the canyon offered was not a command or a promise. It was a surface. It was rest. It was the black varnish reaching, as it has always reached, for whatever stands still long enough.</p>
<hr>
<p>I heard the rifle hit the ground. Sound carries out of the canyon in ways that don’t make sense — you can hear a man breathing a half mile in but you can’t hear a gunshot from the mouth. I heard the rifle and I knew he’d reached the back wall.</p>
<p>I put the coffee on.</p>
<hr>
<p>Gage looked at the face in the wall. He looked at it for what felt like a long time.</p>
<p>His hands were open and his arms were heavy and his knees wanted to bend. The air was so sweet he could taste it on his teeth and the warmth had moved from his hands up his forearms and it wasn’t unpleasant, that was the thing about it, it wasn’t pain or cold or any of the sensations his training had prepared him for. It was warmth and sweetness and something else he didn’t have a word for.</p>
<p>He looked at Luisa’s face in the varnish and he thought about the man against the wall with his arms gone to black and his smile and his white teeth and the word he’d said. Paid.</p>
<p>Gage bent down and picked up the rifle.</p>
<p>It took everything. His fingers didn’t want to close. His arms didn’t want to lift. His back didn’t want to straighten. Every part of him had entered into its own negotiation with the sweet warm air and every part of him had been ready to sign. But his right hand — the hand that had held the Sharps for eleven years, the hand that was dumb and calloused and knew one thing — his right hand closed on the stock and he straightened up and the rifle was heavy in a way it had never been heavy before, the heaviness of a thing that insists you remain yourself.</p>
<p>He didn’t turn around.</p>
<p>He walked backward. One step. Another. His eyes on the black wall, on the face that was already losing its precision, becoming varnish again, becoming rock. He kept the rifle in front of him, stock against his hip, barrel pointed at the wall, though he understood without examining the thought that the rifle was not pointed at anything the rifle could address. It was a grammar. Subject, verb, object. A man holding a weapon retreating from a place. As long as the grammar held, he was still on this side of whatever the varnish-man had crossed to.</p>
<p>He walked backward and the walls widened around him and the air thinned and the sweetness faded by degrees, the way a fever breaks — not all at once but in a slow recession of heat. The light began to behave itself again, remembering what angle February required of it.</p>
<p>He counted his steps. Forty-seven from the dead end to the turn. Sixty-two from the turn to the narrow passage. He shuffled through the passage sideways, still facing inward, the varnish wet against his shoulder blades. The wet soaked through his shirt and he felt it on his skin, warm, and his skin didn’t mind it and that was the part that scared him.</p>
<p>Eighty more steps to the camp, where the tents stood and the provisions rotted and the flat rock where the money had been was empty now. The rock was clean. Not just empty — clean, as if no one had ever set anything on it.</p>
<p>He kept walking. He did not look at the varnished man. He heard breathing as he passed, or thought he did. He did not stop.</p>
<p>One hundred and nine steps from the camp to the mouth.</p>
<p>The light hit him like water. Real light, directional, coming from the west the way the sun was supposed to come at this hour, casting shadows that pointed east the way shadows were supposed to point. He stood at the canyon’s edge and the sun was low and orange and the shadows were long and the goat was not at its stake. The woman was sitting on the bench with two cups.</p>
<hr>
<p>She had poured the coffee before he came out. She did not say how she knew when to pour it.</p>
<p>He came out walking backward. That’s not a thing people do. He came out facing the canyon like he thought it might follow him and when his boots hit the flat ground past the mouth he stopped and stood there and didn’t turn around for a long time.</p>
<p>When he turned around his face looked the same as when he went in. That doesn’t mean anything. Faces are liars.</p>
<p>He sat down and I gave him the coffee and he drank it. His hands were shaking. His left hand had a dark spot on the palm, like a bruise that goes the wrong color. It wasn’t a bruise. I’ve seen bruises.</p>
<p>He didn’t say what happened. He didn’t say anything for twenty minutes. Then he said, “You’ve got good water here.”</p>
<p>I said, “I know.”</p>
<p>The $200 was on my counter when I went inside. I hadn’t put it there. He hadn’t come inside. It was stacked the same way I’d heard the lawyer in Tucson wanted it — paper on the bottom, coins on top. I left it there until he got up and then I told him it was there and he put it in his coat pocket without counting it.</p>
<p>He asked me my name. I told him.</p>
<p>“Dorotea,” he said. “That’s a good name.”</p>
<p>I told him his horse had water and his rifle had dust on it.</p>
<hr>
<p>The canyon breathes still. At dusk the exhalation is visible — a faint distortion of the air at the mouth, a shimmering that is not heat because the temperature drops at dusk, and is not a mirage because mirages require distance and the canyon’s mouth is close enough to touch. The varnish thickens by a fraction of a micrometer each year, which is to say it grows at the speed of patience, which is to say it is always growing, which is to say that what happened to the man with the black arms is happening to the walls and has been happening since before the territory had a name, and will continue after the territory forgets it.</p>
<p>The goat knows. The goat has always known. That is the bargain of the Judas creature — to stand at the threshold and know what lies beyond and to remain, by the grace of its usefulness, on this side. The woman and the goat have negotiated their own terms with something that does not negotiate. It is not affection. It is the professional respect of sentries.</p>
<p>The coins in the man’s pocket carry a residue of varnish so faint that only a microscope would find it. The dark spot on his palm will not wash off. It will not fade. It is not a wound. It is a receipt.</p>
<hr>
<p>He left on a Friday. I don’t know what came out of the canyon but it drank coffee and it had his horse and it knew the dead woman’s name. That was close enough.</p>
<p>I tied the goat out at dusk. She stood where she stands. The canyon was quiet. It’s always quiet after.</p>
<p>I counted the money. I don’t know why. Two hundred dollars exactly.</p>   </section> <div class="reading-footer" data-astro-cid-r24qxsko> <div class="reading-footer__nav" data-astro-cid-r24qxsko> <a href="/work/debt-and-varnish/" class="reading-footer__back" data-astro-cid-r24qxsko> <svg width="16" height="16" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" aria-hidden="true" data-astro-cid-r24qxsko><path d="M19 12H5" data-astro-cid-r24qxsko></path><path d="M12 19l-7-7 7-7" data-astro-cid-r24qxsko></path></svg>
