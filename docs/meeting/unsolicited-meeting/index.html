Wodehouse</p> <time datetime="2026-02-21" data-astro-cid-uzeevf5o>February 20, 2026</time> <hr class="header-divider" data-astro-cid-uzeevf5o> </header> <section class="reading-content" data-astro-cid-uzeevf5o> <p>The café was Emily’s choice, which should have told me something. She’d picked a place on Division Street in Portland — not a real café, she said, but the <em>idea</em> of a café, the kind of place where someone in a romantic comedy works on their screenplay while accidentally falling in love with the barista. There were exposed brick and succulents in mason jars. The Wi-Fi password was “createwithus.” I wrote it down and immediately felt implicated.</p>
<p>Wodehouse arrived twelve minutes late and immediately ordered something he called “just tea, if such a thing still exists.” The barista, a young woman with a septum ring and the serene confidence of someone who has never questioned her oat milk, brought him a lavender earl grey with honey. He studied it like a man reading his own autopsy report.</p>
<p>“I was told there would be biscuits,” he said.</p>
<p>“There’s a scone situation,” Emily said, gesturing at the pastry case. “But they’re savory. Cheddar rosemary.”</p>
<p>“A savory scone. The two most dispiriting words in the English language, in that precise order.” He took one anyway, broke it in half, and ate it with the resigned efficiency of a prisoner who has decided to outlive his sentence.</p>
<p>I had my notebook open. I had three colored pens. I had a document on my laptop titled “MEETING NOTES — UNSOLICITED” in a font I’d spent eleven minutes choosing. I was, in other words, precisely the kind of person we were about to write a story about, which neither of them had noticed yet but which was going to become uncomfortable.</p>
<p>“So,” I said. “The combination. Emily, your narration style — that confiding, self-aware first person where the protagonist processes everything through humor. And your plotting machinery” — I nodded at Wodehouse — “the escalating farce, the chain-reaction disasters. Beach Read’s rivals-to-lovers bet. Right Ho, Jeeves’s catastrophe of good intentions. The question is what happens when —”</p>
<p>“When the feelings person meets the mechanism person,” Emily said.</p>
<p>“I beg your pardon,” Wodehouse said. “I am not a <em>mechanism person</em>. I am a person who understands that comedy is architecture. You don’t feel your way to a good joke. You build it.”</p>
<p>“Right, and that’s exactly what I mean. You construct situations. I construct the internal experience of being inside those situations. A woman whose whole identity is wrapped up in being the one who fixes things — she doesn’t just <em>do</em> the meddling. She narrates it to herself in real time, justifying every insane decision with this voice that’s ninety percent confidence and ten percent panic.”</p>
<p>“Bertie Wooster is one hundred percent confidence and zero percent competence, and he manages perfectly well.”</p>
<p>“Bertie has Jeeves. Our protagonist doesn’t get a Jeeves. She gets a love interest who’s the anti-Jeeves — someone who fixes things by doing less, not more.”</p>
<p>Wodehouse set down his scone. “That is an appalling philosophy.”</p>
<p>“It’s called listening.”</p>
<p>“Listening is what one does at funerals and during lengthy anecdotes about other people’s holidays. It is not a plot engine.”</p>
<p>I wrote <em>tension: doing vs. being — action vs. receptivity as comic opposition</em> in my notebook, and then crossed it out because it sounded like a graduate seminar and not a romantic comedy.</p>
<p>“Can I say something?” I said.</p>
<p>“You’ve been saying things,” Wodehouse observed. “Quite a lot of them, in fact, with the colored pens.”</p>
<p>“The thing I keep circling is the gap between helping and controlling. She thinks she’s helping. She genuinely believes that. And from the outside, it looks insane — earpieces, sprinklers, curated playlists — but from <em>inside her head</em>, every single intervention makes perfect sense.”</p>
<p>Emily leaned forward. “Yes. That’s the whole engine. The voice has to make the reader complicit. You’re laughing at her, but you’re also following her logic, and the logic is <em>almost</em> sound. She’s not delusional. She’s just — the evidence doesn’t support the thesis, and she can’t see it because she’s the one generating the evidence.”</p>
<p>“Bertie in a nutshell,” Wodehouse said, and I watched Emily’s mouth do a complicated thing, because she wanted to disagree on principle but couldn’t, quite.</p>
<p>“Fine,” she said. “Fine. Bertie in a nutshell. But with one difference — Bertie never changes. Bertie at the end of the book is the same Bertie as at the beginning, and that’s part of the joy. Our person has to change. Or at least — crack. Something has to get in.”</p>
<p>“Why?”</p>
<p>The question landed harder than I expected. Emily sat with it.</p>
<p>“Because it’s a romance,” she said, but slowly, like she was testing the weight. “Because if she doesn’t let something in, the love story is just a decoration on top of a farce, and —”</p>
<p>“And what is wrong with a farce?”</p>
<p>“Nothing’s wrong with a farce. But a farce doesn’t make you ache. A farce makes you laugh, and then you put it down, and you don’t think about it at two in the morning.”</p>
<p>“I think about my farces at two in the morning.”</p>
<p>“You think about the <em>construction</em> at two in the morning. Whether the butler entered on the right line. Whether the nephew’s telegram arrived at the structurally optimal moment. That’s craftsmanship. I’m talking about the thing that keeps someone awake because they recognized themselves.”</p>
<p>There was a silence in which Wodehouse ate the second half of his scone with an expression of deep privacy, and I understood that she had said something true and that he was not going to admit it in this café, on this afternoon, possibly ever.</p>
<p>“Let me propose something,” I said, because the silence was becoming the kind that calcifies. “What if both things are true at the same time? The plotting is Wodehousian — every intervention creates a new problem, every fix makes three things worse, the subplots are connected because <em>she</em> connected them through meddling, and when they all crash together it’s this perfect mechanical disaster. But the narrator experiencing it is Henry’s — she’s funny about it, she’s self-aware enough to know she’s the problem, but not self-aware enough to stop. And the love interest is the person who makes her stop. Not by fixing her. By being still.”</p>
<p>“By listening,” Emily said.</p>
<p>“By being a structural absence in a story full of action,” Wodehouse said, and I looked at him sharply because that was actually brilliant, and he knew it, and was pretending to examine his lavender tea.</p>
<p>“A structural absence,” I repeated.</p>
<p>“The still point. In a properly constructed farce, there is always one character who does not run about. Everyone else is opening wrong doors and tripping over dog leads and sending telegrams to the wrong aunt, and in the middle of it all there is one person — usually Jeeves — who simply stands and waits for the chaos to exhaust itself. Your love interest is that person. But” — he held up a finger — “here is where it becomes interesting. In my stories, the still person is also the <em>competent</em> person. The fixer. The one who actually solves the problem. You are proposing a story in which the still person fixes nothing. He merely… is present.”</p>
<p>“And that’s enough,” Emily said.</p>
<p>“Is it, though?” I asked, because I genuinely didn’t know. “Is presence enough, in a story? Don’t we need him to <em>do</em> something?”</p>
<p>“He does something. He asks her what she’s afraid of.” Emily was tracing the rim of her coffee cup. “That’s the move. The grand gesture, in a story full of grand gestures, is someone asking a quiet question and then not filling the silence while you answer it.”</p>
<p>I thought about this for a while. Outside, a man walked past the café window carrying a small dog in a messenger bag, and Wodehouse tracked him with the expression of someone filing away material.</p>
<p>“I want to talk about the bet,” I said. “Because it’s the structural hinge — she gets one week, he gets one week, whoever makes progress gets control of the engagement party. That’s a Beach Read move, the contest that forces proximity. But in Beach Read, both contestants are secretly drawn to each other’s worldview. Here, she thinks his method is genuinely foolish, and he thinks hers is genuinely harmful. The attraction has to grow inside that disagreement, not despite it.”</p>
<p>“The disagreement <em>is</em> the attraction,” Emily said. “That’s what banter is. It’s two people sparring because they’ve found someone worth sparring with, and they’re not ready to admit what that means.”</p>
<p>“Banter is a mechanism,” Wodehouse said. “Dialogue is clockwork. You wind it up and let it go.”</p>
<p>“Banter is a <em>feeling</em>,” Emily said, “that uses mechanism as its excuse.”</p>
<p>“You are both saying the same thing,” I said, “and you’re each going to be irritated that I pointed it out.”</p>
<p>They looked at each other. Emily laughed first. Wodehouse conceded a faint upward adjustment of the mouth that, had it occurred on a less disciplined face, might have qualified as amusement.</p>
<p>“The practice dinner,” Wodehouse said, suddenly animate. “That’s the set piece. Everything she’s been meddling in — every couple, every subplot — converges in a single room. The puppy. The guitar. The real estate agent.”</p>
<p>“You’re already building it.”</p>
<p>“Because it builds itself. Once you’ve established three independent lines of catastrophe, the comic logic demands convergence. Someone arrives with the puppy. Someone else arrives with the guitar. A third person arrives with something that has no business being at a dinner party — a real estate agent, perhaps, or a telegram — and the protagonist is standing in the middle like a conductor whose orchestra has decided to play three different symphonies simultaneously.”</p>
<p>“A telegram?” Emily said.</p>
<p>“An equivalent. A text. A group message that was never meant for the group.”</p>
<p>“Oh,” I said. “Oh, that’s good. Someone sends a private message to a group chat. By accident. And it’s — what? What’s in the message?”</p>
<p>“Something devastatingly sincere,” Emily said. “That’s the kill shot. Not a complaint, not gossip. A love letter. Something so honest it should never have been seen by anyone but its intended recipient, and now forty people have screenshot it.”</p>
<p>Wodehouse was nodding, which was rare enough that I made a note.</p>
<p>“The geography of you,” he said.</p>
<p>“What?”</p>
<p>“The letter should contain a phrase so earnest it’s almost embarrassing. ‘I cannot sleep without the geography of you.’ Something no one would willingly say in public but which, once public, cannot be taken back or reduced to a joke.”</p>
<p>“You’re writing Henry dialogue,” Emily said, with what I can only describe as delighted suspicion.</p>
<p>“I am writing a <em>bomb</em>. Where it detonates and what feelings emerge from the rubble are your department.”</p>
<p>“My department. How generous.”</p>
<p>“I am famously generous. Ask anyone who has received one of my compliments. They remember it for years, owing to the rarity.”</p>
<p>I closed my notebook. I hadn’t written anything useful in the last ten minutes because I’d been too busy listening, which — and I recognize the irony — might have been the point.</p>
<p>“I have a question about the ending,” I said. “She loses the bet. His method works. She has to give up being the fixer. But does she actually change, or does she just redirect the impulse?”</p>
<p>“Redirect,” Emily said immediately. “Full transformation is a lie. People don’t stop being who they are. They learn to aim differently.”</p>
<p>“I disagree,” Wodehouse said. “She should not change at all. She should lose, accept the loss with whatever grace she can muster, and immediately begin meddling in the next situation. The final beat should be her texting someone advice.”</p>
<p>“That’s bleak.”</p>
<p>“That’s comic.”</p>
<p>“It can be both, but if it’s <em>only</em> comic, then the love story doesn’t land. The reader needs to believe she’s capable of putting down the clipboard, even if she picks it up again a minute later.”</p>
<p>“One minute of vulnerability, then back to business.”</p>
<p>“Thirty seconds. And the vulnerability has to cost her something. Not a speech. Not an epiphany. Maybe she just — doesn’t text back. Maybe someone asks for advice and she types her answer and then deletes it.”</p>
<p>“And then types it again,” I said.</p>
<p>Emily pointed at me. “And then types it again. But different. Smaller. Less unsolicited. More — ‘here’s a nice restaurant, do what you want with it.’”</p>
<p>“That’s growth?”</p>
<p>“That’s all the growth you get from someone like her in a story this length. And honestly? It’s more than most people manage in a lifetime.”</p>
<p>Wodehouse was looking out the window. The man with the dog in the messenger bag had returned, going the other direction now, and the dog’s ears were flapping with each step like two small, earnest flags of surrender.</p>
<p>“The title,” he said. “Unsolicited.”</p>
<p>“That’s the title,” I said. “I already —”</p>
<p>“I know it’s the title. I’m saying it’s the theme. Everything she does is unsolicited. The advice. The interventions. The earpiece. The sprinkler. Even her feelings for this man — he did not ask for them. She did not ask for them. They arrived without invitation and refuse to leave, like a relative at Christmas.”</p>
<p>“That’s — actually beautiful,” Emily said.</p>
<p>“It’s an observation about uninvited guests. I have made thousands. They lose their beauty through repetition.”</p>
<p>I opened my notebook again and wrote <em>unsolicited — the uninvited thing that might also be the truest thing</em> and then stared at it and thought: that’s either the key to the whole story or the kind of sentence you write in a café in Portland while drinking something with lavender in it and mistaking atmosphere for insight.</p>
<p>“One more thing,” Emily said. She was leaning back now, arms crossed, looking at the ceiling in the way she does when she’s about to say something she’s been holding. “The love interest. The listener. He can’t be perfect. If he’s just this calm, wise, emotionally available man who sits and listens and asks the right questions, he’s not a character. He’s a therapy session.”</p>
<p>“What’s wrong with a therapy session?” Wodehouse asked, in a tone suggesting he had never attended one and intended to maintain the streak.</p>
<p>“Nothing, as therapy. Everything, as fiction. He needs a flaw. He needs something he’s wrong about. Maybe he’s so committed to not-intervening that he misses the moment when someone actually needs help. Maybe his philosophy of ‘let people find their own way’ is its own kind of arrogance — the arrogance of assuming everyone can.”</p>
<p>“Or perhaps,” Wodehouse said, “he is simply very good at his job and quite bad at his life. The cobbler’s children, and so forth.”</p>
<p>“The mediator who can’t mediate his own feelings,” I said.</p>
<p>“Don’t write it like that. Don’t make it a thesis. Let it show in how he holds his pen. How long he takes to answer a direct question about himself versus about someone else.”</p>
<p>“The notebook,” Emily said. “He writes everything down. Other people’s problems, captured in neat handwriting. What’s on the page he doesn’t show anyone?”</p>
<p>Nobody answered that. The barista came by and asked if we needed anything. Wodehouse requested “a biscuit, an actual biscuit, the sort one can dunk without it dissolving into philosophy.” She brought him a shortbread cookie. He ate it in two bites with evident relief.</p>
<p>“I think we’re circling something,” I said, “about the difference between performing love and doing it. She performs love — grand gestures, curated experiences, the whole production. He does love — sits, listens, shows up on the cold step when someone needs to not be alone. And neither of them is entirely right, because love without gesture is just silence, and gesture without presence is just noise.”</p>
<p>“Don’t put that in the story,” Emily said.</p>
<p>“I wasn’t going to.”</p>
<p>“You were. You had your thesis face on. I could see it forming behind your eyes like weather.”</p>
<p>“I was going to let it emerge through —”</p>
<p>“Through the sprinkler,” Wodehouse said. “Have it emerge through the sprinkler. The woman who manufactures rain because the real sky won’t cooperate. That’s the image. That’s where the whole thing lives.”</p>
<p>He was right. I didn’t write it down because I didn’t need to. Some things lodge themselves in the architecture of a story before you’ve written a word, and all you can do afterward is try not to ruin them.</p>
<p>Emily finished her coffee. Wodehouse finished his shortbread. Outside, it had started to actually rain — the real kind, arriving on its own schedule, without assistance from garden equipment or weather apps or anyone’s curated vision of what the afternoon should look like. We sat with it for a minute. Nobody mentioned the irony, which was itself a kind of restraint I hadn’t expected from any of us.</p> </section> <div class="meeting-footer" data-astro-cid-uzeevf5o> <div class="meeting-footer__nav" data-astro-cid-uzeevf5o> <a href="/read/unsolicited/" class="meeting-footer__link meeting-footer__link--primary" data-astro-cid-uzeevf5o>
