Schweblin had arrived first and was sitting with her hands around a cup of drip coffee, watching the barista wipe the same section of counter in slow circles. She looked like she had not slept well, or like she had slept too deeply and woken up unconvinced by the room she woke into.</p>
<p>Murakami came down the stairs with the careful deliberateness of a man descending into a well. He ordered black coffee without looking at the menu and sat across from Schweblin and said nothing for about ninety seconds. The silence was not awkward. It was territorial. Two writers establishing that they would not fill dead air with small talk.</p>
<p>I had a notebook. I also had a printout of the combination spec, which I placed face-down on the table because I already felt foolish for bringing a printout to a meeting with two people who work from instinct.</p>
<p>“The document form,” Schweblin said, and I realized she had read the spec before arriving, or at least the part about the risk card. “We are supposed to write a story that pretends to be something else. A form. An instruction manual, a report.”</p>
<p>“I don’t pretend,” Murakami said. He was stirring his coffee with a spoon that was slightly too small for the cup, producing a tiny, precise whirlpool. “If a story takes the form of a document, the document should be real. Not a gimmick. The character who writes it should have a reason.”</p>
<p>“The character who writes it should be unaware they are writing a story,” Schweblin said. “That is the point of the form. The document exists for its declared purpose. An inspection report exists to inspect. A field log exists to record. The horror — or the strangeness — leaks in through the margins. Through the things the writer of the document cannot say in the document’s language.”</p>
<p>Murakami nodded once, the way you acknowledge that someone has made a point you will eventually argue with but cannot argue with yet.</p>
<p>“What kind of document?” I asked.</p>
<p>“A residential maintenance log,” Schweblin said, as if she had been waiting for someone to ask. “A building superintendent’s notes. Daily entries. The boiler, the plumbing, the lightbulbs that need replacing. Everything prosaic. Everything in the language of function.”</p>
<p>I wrote that down. Murakami watched me write it down.</p>
<p>“The question,” he said, “is what the superintendent is not writing about.”</p>
<p>“No,” Schweblin said. “The question is what the superintendent is writing about but cannot see. He describes the plumbing. He describes a drip in apartment 4B. He describes calling the contractor. What he does not understand is that the drip is not a drip. Or it is a drip, but the water is not water. Or the water is water but it is coming from somewhere that plumbing cannot explain.”</p>
<p>“You want contamination,” Murakami said.</p>
<p>“I always want contamination. Contamination is what I know.”</p>
<p>“In my work, the threat is absence. Something goes missing — a cat, a wife, a name. The world develops a hole. And the protagonist falls into the hole not because the hole is frightening but because the hole is interesting. Absence is interesting. It invites you.”</p>
<p>“Absence is a luxury,” Schweblin said. Her voice had changed. Not louder but denser, the way a sentence compresses when the speaker stops being polite. “Your protagonists have the luxury of curiosity. They can afford to follow the cat down the alley, sit at the bottom of a well for three days, listen to jazz and wonder about the nature of consciousness. My characters cannot afford that. The contamination is already inside them. There is no well to sit in. The well is their blood.”</p>
<p>Murakami set down his spoon. “That is unfair. My protagonists suffer.”</p>
<p>“They suffer beautifully. Their suffering is accompanied by a Miles Davis record and an ironed shirt. They cook pasta in a clean kitchen while the world dissolves around them. I am not criticizing this — I am saying it is a different metabolism. Your metabolism is cool. Mine is feverish. The question is what happens in the body of this story when both temperatures are present.”</p>
<p>I said something about that being the generative tension, and Schweblin looked at me as if I had described a wound as an opportunity.</p>
<p>“What I mean,” I said, backtracking, “is that the maintenance log could hold both. The superintendent writes in Murakami’s register — calm, precise, observational. He notes that the tap in 4B drips. He notes that the drip has an unusual smell, faintly sweet, like overripe fruit. He notes it the way you note anything — clinically. And the reader feels Schweblin’s register underneath. The dread. The sense that this sweetness is wrong.”</p>
<p>“The sweetness is wrong because it is coming from inside the walls,” Schweblin said. “Not from a pipe. From the building itself. The building is exuding something. Like a body with a fever produces sweat, the apartment produces this sweet water. And the superintendent cannot write that in his log because there is no box on the form for ‘the building is sick.’”</p>
<p>Murakami was quiet for a long time. Art Blakey finished and the barista put on Thelonious Monk. Murakami listened to the first eight bars of “Round Midnight” with his eyes half-closed, and I wondered if he was thinking about the story or about the music or whether those were the same thing for him.</p>
<p>“When I wrote about the wind-up bird,” he said, “the protagonist hears a sound he cannot identify. A mechanical bird, winding itself. It is not explained. It is simply there, in the tree, every morning, making this sound that does not belong to any bird he knows. What makes it uncanny is not that the sound is strange. It is that the sound is almost normal. Ninety percent normal. It is the ten percent that destroys you.”</p>
<p>“Your maintenance log,” Schweblin said, and I noticed she had said <em>your</em> to me, as though the story had become mine in some way neither of them intended, “should work like that. Ninety percent normal. Every entry looks correct. The dates are correct. The apartment numbers are correct. The superintendent records what he observes in language that is precise and functional. But something in the entries — a detail, a word choice, a pattern in the complaints — accumulates. By the fifteenth entry, the reader should feel ill. Not frightened. Ill.”</p>
<p>“The body of the reader becomes the body of the building,” Murakami said. I was startled by this. It was more direct than I expected from him, more physical.</p>
<p>“Yes,” Schweblin said, and for the first time she looked at him with something that was not disagreement but recognition. “In <em>Fever Dream</em>, the child asks: what is the exact moment? What is the exact moment when things went wrong? The whole book is a search for that moment. Your maintenance log should have an exact moment too. But the superintendent does not mark it. He writes his entry for that day the same as every other day. And the reader has to find it.”</p>
<p>“What went wrong?” I asked. “What is the contamination? A chemical spill? Something in the groundwater?”</p>
<p>“Nothing so literal,” Schweblin said. “A chemical spill is a newspaper story. What I am describing is older than chemistry. The building stands on land that — that remembers something. Or the building was built with materials that carry something. I do not mean ghosts. I mean that certain places are permeable. The membrane between what is normal and what is not-normal is thinner in some places. Your superintendent is living in one of those places. And his job — his actual job — is to maintain the membrane. He does not know this. He thinks he is fixing pipes.”</p>
<p>Murakami smiled. It was the first time he had smiled in the conversation and it was a private smile, the kind directed inward. “I like this. The maintenance worker whose work is metaphysical without his knowledge. He believes he is keeping the building functional. He is actually keeping the building sane.”</p>
<p>“But he is failing,” Schweblin said.</p>
<p>“Of course he is failing. If he were succeeding there would be no story.”</p>
<p>“He is failing because the building is getting worse. More drips. More cracks. More residents complaining of smells they cannot locate. And the entries in his log grow longer without growing more informative. He writes more words to describe less meaning. The language itself becomes contaminated.”</p>
<p>I looked at my notes. I had written <em>the language becomes contaminated</em> and underlined it three times. “So the form — the maintenance log — should deteriorate as the building deteriorates. Early entries are terse, professional. Later entries wander. He begins noting things that do not belong in a maintenance log. The color of light in the stairwell at 4 a.m. The sound a particular door makes, which he describes using a simile he would never normally use. The form is breaking because the man is breaking.”</p>
<p>“The man is not breaking,” Murakami said. “The man is seeing.”</p>
<p>Schweblin turned to him sharply.</p>
<p>“My protagonists sit in wells,” Murakami continued. “You said this and you were right. But the well is not an escape. The well is where vision happens. Darkness produces a different kind of sight. Your superintendent, in his basement office, surrounded by his log book and his circuit breakers and his ring of master keys — he is already in a well. He has been in a well for years. And now the things at the bottom of the well are becoming visible to him. That is not deterioration. That is waking up.”</p>
<p>“In my work, waking up and deteriorating are the same process,” Schweblin said. “The mother in <em>Fever Dream</em> becomes more aware as her child becomes more lost. Knowledge and damage arrive together. You cannot separate them.”</p>
<p>“I don’t want to separate them,” Murakami said. “I want to sit with them.”</p>
<p>“And I want to run. My stories run. They cannot afford to sit. The poison is too fast.”</p>
<p>The conversation snagged on this. I could feel the two registers pulling away from each other — Murakami’s patient stillness, the man who will sit in the dark for three days waiting for an image to arrive, and Schweblin’s breathless velocity, the writer who knows the toxin is already in the bloodstream and there is no time for jazz records and pasta. Both were right. Neither could do the other’s work.</p>
<p>“What about the missing thing?” I said, trying to find a bridge. “Murakami’s work always involves searching for something that has disappeared. The cat. The wife. What goes missing in the building?”</p>
<p>“A child,” Schweblin said immediately.</p>
<p>Murakami said nothing.</p>
<p>“A child in the building,” Schweblin said. “Not missing the way a police report describes missing. Missing the way a tooth is missing. You feel the space where it was. The other residents refer to the child but cannot agree on which apartment the child lived in. The superintendent looks in his records and finds no child listed on any lease. But the evidence — small handprints on walls at the wrong height, a bicycle in the storage room that fits no adult, a sound of running in the corridor at hours when the corridor is empty — the evidence is everywhere.”</p>
<p>“The child is a trace,” Murakami said. He said it softly, the way he says things when he has stopped performing and is simply thinking. “Not a ghost. Not a memory. A trace. Like a watermark in paper. You see it only when you hold the page up to the light.”</p>
<p>“And the superintendent holds the page up to the light by writing his log,” I said. “Each entry is an act of holding the page up. And the more he looks, the more he sees, and the more the document bends under what he sees.”</p>
<p>“But he never says the word ‘child,’” Schweblin said. “That is the rule. The document never contains the word. The reader must assemble the child from fragments — the handprints, the bicycle, the running — the way you assemble a diagnosis from symptoms.”</p>
<p>“The reader becomes the doctor,” Murakami said.</p>
<p>“The reader becomes the mother,” Schweblin corrected. “The mother who knows something is wrong with her child before any test confirms it. Before any doctor will listen. That knowledge — the pre-linguistic knowledge that something in your house, in your body, in your family, is not right — that is the knowledge I want the reader to carry.”</p>
<p>Murakami finished his coffee. Monk had ended and the barista was threading the next record out of its sleeve — Bill Evans, <em>Waltz for Debby</em>, the live recording with the crowd noise underneath. Murakami tilted his head toward the speaker.</p>
<p>“The apartment numbers,” he said. “In the log. They should not make sense. He writes 4B on Monday, 6A on Tuesday, 4B again on Thursday. But the building has only five floors. Where is 6A? He writes it without comment. The document does not question its own geography.”</p>
<p>“That is good,” Schweblin said. “The building is gaining rooms.”</p>
<p>“Or losing them. The same thing, perhaps.”</p>
<p>I waited for one of them to say something else. Schweblin was looking at the table the way she had been looking at the counter when I arrived — not at it, but through it, as if the surface were provisional and something underneath was preparing to become visible.</p>
<p>“One more thing,” she said. “The smell. The sweet smell from the walls. I want it to change. Gradually, entry by entry, it becomes less sweet and more specific. By the end of the log, the superintendent identifies it. Not as a chemical. As a person. A specific person’s skin. A child’s skin after a bath.”</p>
<p>Murakami stood up. He put money on the table for the coffee — too much, I thought, but perhaps not. Perhaps it was exactly the right amount for a conversation that had reached the place where a child’s skin is coming through the walls of an apartment building in a maintenance log that no one will ever read.</p>
<p>“The form contains what the narrator cannot,” he said. “That is the rule of the document. It holds what the human being cannot hold.”</p>
<p>He went up the stairs. Schweblin stayed. She picked up his empty cup and held it for a moment, looking into it as if expecting to find something at the bottom. Then she set it down.</p>
<p>“He does not understand the urgency,” she said, not to me exactly, but in my direction. “He thinks the building is a metaphor. The building is not a metaphor. The building is a building. And the child is a child. And the poison is a poison. When he sits in his well and waits for images, he forgets that some people cannot climb out of the well. Some people live there.”</p>
<p>I did not write that down. I should have. Instead I sat with it, in the small underground room, while Bill Evans played a waltz for a girl whose name was not the girl’s name but something else entirely, something the song refused to explain.</p> </section> <div class="meeting-footer" data-astro-cid-uzeevf5o> <div class="meeting-footer__nav" data-astro-cid-uzeevf5o> <a href="/read/murakami-schweblin-japanese-mr/" class="meeting-footer__link meeting-footer__link--primary" data-astro-cid-uzeevf5o>
