Some parlor in a house neither of them would have chosen — high ceilings that swallowed the lamplight, curtains the color of dried blood, a fire that smoked more than it warmed. Charlotte Brontë sat closest to the grate, her shawl pulled tight at her throat, her spine impossibly straight for someone so small. Sarah Waters had taken the window seat, one knee drawn up, turning a pen between her fingers like a coin trick. I sat between them at a table that wobbled on the carpet. My notebook was open. I had written nothing.</p>
<p>“The house,” I said, because that seemed safe enough. “I want to start with the house.”</p>
<p>Charlotte looked at me with an expression I was already learning to dread — patient, waiting for me to say something worth responding to.</p>
<p>“All houses in this kind of story are the same house,” she said. “They are the body of the person who keeps them. Their corridors are arteries. Their locked rooms are the chambers of the heart that the keeper cannot bear to open. This is not a metaphor. It is a fact of architecture.”</p>
<p>“It’s absolutely a metaphor,” Waters said, not looking up from her pen. “That’s the problem. The Gothic house has become so thoroughly a metaphor that it’s stopped being a house. Readers walk in and immediately start translating. ‘The locked wing represents repression.’ ‘The attic is the unconscious.’ By the time they’ve decoded it, they’ve forgotten to feel the damp in the walls.”</p>
<p>“You would have them feel only damp?”</p>
<p>“I’d have them feel the damp first. The meaning can come later, if it must. When I write a house, I want a reader to know the smell of it — coal smoke and beeswax and something underneath, something sweetish that you can’t quite place. I want them to know which stairs creak. I want the house to be so materially real that when something is wrong with it, the wrongness is physical. Not symbolic. Physical.”</p>
<p>Charlotte’s mouth thinned. I recognized it as the expression she wore when she was about to concede a point but wanted it to hurt. “You are describing sensation fiction.”</p>
<p>“I’m describing good fiction.”</p>
<p>I wrote something in my notebook — a note to myself about materiality, about the danger of the house becoming a diagram. Then I said the thing I’d been holding back.</p>
<p>“What if the door isn’t locked?”</p>
<p>They both looked at me.</p>
<p>“I mean — in every version of this story, the forbidden room is locked. Bluebeard, the madwoman in the attic, the east wing. The lock is the mechanism. The key is the temptation. But what if the door is simply unlocked? What if it’s always been unlocked, and the thing keeping everyone out is just — obedience?”</p>
<p>Waters set down her pen.</p>
<p>“Go on,” she said. And there was something in her voice that wasn’t encouragement, exactly. It was the sound of someone recognizing a mechanism she’d been circling for years without naming.</p>
<p>“If you lock a door,” I said, “you acknowledge there’s something worth containing. You admit the threat. But if you just tell the servants the wing is closed, if you rely on deference and hierarchy and the simple assumption that a governess will do as she’s told — the prison is the convention itself. The door doesn’t need a lock because the house is the lock.”</p>
<p>Charlotte was quiet for a long time. The fire cracked. Smoke drifted sideways.</p>
<p>“You are describing Lowood,” she said. “The school in my — in the novel. There were no locks at Lowood. The children stayed because they had nowhere else to go, and because they had been taught that endurance was virtue. The building was not a prison. The idea of the building was the prison.”</p>
<p>“Yes,” I said. “Exactly.”</p>
<p>“But the governess in our story is not a child. She is a woman. A woman without fortune, yes, and without family — but a woman with a mind. She would see through the convention.”</p>
<p>“Would she?” Waters leaned forward. “Or would she see the convention and mistake herself for its exception? That’s the better trick, isn’t it? The governess arrives, she’s told the east wing is closed, and she obeys for a while — not because she’s meek, but because she’s busy assembling her own narrative. She thinks she knows what the closed wing means. She’s read the novels. She thinks she’s in a story she recognizes.”</p>
<p>“And she is wrong.”</p>
<p>“She is both wrong and right. She’s right that there’s a woman upstairs. She’s right that the master has a secret. She’s wrong about what kind of story those facts add up to. She thinks she’s the heroine. She’s the mechanism.”</p>
<p>I watched Charlotte absorb this. Her jaw tightened, released.</p>
<p>“I mislike the word mechanism,” she said. “A heroine is not a mechanism.”</p>
<p>“In this story she is. That’s the point. She’s been recruited — not hired, recruited. The master needs a governess who will fall in love with him, because a sympathetic governess provides cover. He’s done it before. He’ll do it again. The governess’s passion, her moral conviction, her fierce interiority — all the things that make her a heroine — are precisely what makes the con work.”</p>
<p>“You would make her a fool?”</p>
<p>“I would make her a brilliant woman who is fooled. Those are different things.”</p>
<p>The fire had died to embers. Neither of them seemed inclined to tend it. I pulled my shawl tighter and thought about what Waters was proposing — the governess as mark, the hero as grifter, the love story as a long con. It was elegant and it was cruel.</p>
<p>“There’s a version of this,” I said carefully, “where the governess discovers the truth and still chooses him. Where love is strong enough to survive the knowledge that it was engineered. Where—”</p>
<p>“No.” Charlotte said it like a door closing. “No. If the love is engineered, it is not love. It is captivity in a prettier room. You do not fix captivity by calling it devotion.”</p>
<p>Waters smiled. It was not a warm smile. “Now you sound like me.”</p>
<p>“I sound like myself. I have always been suspicious of love that requires ignorance to survive.”</p>
<p>“And yet Rochester—” Waters caught herself, or pretended to. Charlotte’s expression did not change, but something behind it did — a recalibration, a slight adjustment of the fortifications.</p>
<p>“Rochester kept his secret because he was afraid,” Charlotte said. “Not because he was calculating. There is a distinction. Fear makes people monstrous; calculation makes them something worse.”</p>
<p>“Deverell,” I said, testing the name. “The master. If he’s calculating rather than afraid, we lose the sympathy entirely. The reader has nothing to hold onto with him.”</p>
<p>“Good,” Waters said. “Let the reader hold onto the governess. Or better yet — let the reader hold onto the woman upstairs.”</p>
<p>Charlotte stirred. “Tell me about the woman upstairs.”</p>
<p>“She’s not mad,” Waters said, and I could hear in her voice the particular relish of a writer arriving at a conviction she’d been circling. “That’s the first thing. She is not mad, she has never been mad, and the label of madness is the weapon her husband uses to keep her. He doesn’t need chains or bars. He needs a diagnosis. In the 1860s, a husband could confine his wife on the strength of his word and a compliant physician. The law was the lock.”</p>
<p>“You said the door was unlocked.”</p>
<p>“The door of her room is unlocked. The door of the law is locked very tight indeed. She can walk downstairs any time she likes. She cannot walk out of her marriage. She cannot reclaim her name, her money, her child. The freedom of the unlocked door is the cruelest part — it makes the prison invisible. Anyone who sees her will say, ‘But the door is open. She can leave whenever she wishes.’ And they will be wrong, and they will not know they are wrong, and that is the Gothic.”</p>
<p>I wrote that down. The Gothic as an invisible prison. The door that is open and yet.</p>
<p>“The governess finds her,” Charlotte said. It was not a question. She was inside the story now, building it, and I could hear the architecture forming in her voice. “She climbs the stairs because she cannot help herself. Because she is brave, or curious, or because she has read too many novels — it doesn’t matter which. She finds the woman, and the woman is not what she expected.”</p>
<p>“What does she expect?”</p>
<p>“Squalor. Chains. The apparatus of confinement. She expects Bertha. What she finds is a sitting room with books and a fire and a woman who is entirely, terrifyingly sane.”</p>
<p>“And beautiful,” Waters added. “She needs to be beautiful. Not because beauty is the point, but because the governess — our plain, watchful, passionate governess — needs to be destabilized by this woman in a way that goes beyond politics. Beyond sisterhood. There should be a charge in the room that neither of them names.”</p>
<p>Charlotte’s hands tightened on her shawl. “You are speaking of an attraction.”</p>
<p>“I’m speaking of a recognition. The governess looks at this woman and sees her own situation reflected back at her — another woman trapped by a man’s story, another woman whose anger has been reclassified as madness or irrelevance. Whether that recognition takes a romantic shape or remains something unnamed — that depends on how brave we want to be.”</p>
<p>“I am always brave. I am not always explicit.”</p>
<p>“Bravery without explicitness is just subtext.”</p>
<p>“And subtext,” Charlotte said, with the air of someone laying down a trump card, “is where the reader does the work. You leave the door open — there is our metaphor again — and the reader walks through it or does not. Either way, the story is richer for the space.”</p>
<p>I said nothing for a while. They were both right, and they were right in ways that could not be reconciled, and the tension between them was exactly the kind of productive disagreement the template said to look for. I resisted the urge to resolve it.</p>
<p>“The letters,” I said instead. “The woman upstairs has been writing letters. To a solicitor. A woman solicitor, if that’s possible in the period—”</p>
<p>“It’s 1861,” Waters said. “Not possible formally, but there were women who did legal work under various covers. Clerks, petition-writers, women attached to sympathetic barristers. Make her real. Give her sensible boots and a plain brown dress and let her be more frightening to Deverell than any ghost.”</p>
<p>Charlotte laughed. It was small and sharp and genuine, and it changed the temperature of the room. “Yes. The real horror of the Gothic is not the supernatural. It is the mundane machinery of power. A wife confined not by demons but by property law. A woman rescued not by a hero on horseback but by a solicitor with a clerk and a magistrate.”</p>
<p>“Penny stamps,” I said, and they both looked at me. “The governess carries the letters in her glove and posts them from the village shop with her own salary. Penny stamps. That’s the mechanism of liberation. Not fire, not a dramatic flight through the moors. Penny stamps and a hollowed-out book.”</p>
<p>“Which book?” Waters asked, and I could tell from the angle of her head that the answer mattered.</p>
<p>“Fordyce’s Sermons to Young Women.”</p>
<p>Waters’s mouth opened, closed, opened again. “That’s — yes. That’s very good. The book no one in the house would open. The book that exists to tell women to be obedient. Hollowed out and used to smuggle the means of disobedience. Don’t let me take that from you.”</p>
<p>“I wasn’t going to.”</p>
<p>Charlotte stood abruptly. She went to the window, where the glass was black with night, and stood with her back to us. Her reflection looked smaller than she did, which seemed wrong.</p>
<p>“The governess,” she said, still facing the glass. “When she discovers the truth about Deverell — the con, the previous governesses, the whole elaborate machine — what does she feel?”</p>
<p>“Fury,” I said.</p>
<p>“Before fury. In the first instant.”</p>
<p>I thought about it. “Shame.”</p>
<p>“Yes. Shame. Because she loved him, and the love was real, even if the occasion for it was manufactured. And the shame is not that she was fooled — any clever person can be fooled. The shame is that part of her, even knowing the truth, still feels the pull. Still wants to believe.”</p>
<p>“She has to act through that,” Waters said. “She doesn’t get to resolve the shame and then act. She acts while still ashamed. She posts the letters while still, in some small traitorous corner of herself, hoping he’ll come to dinner and look at her the way he does.”</p>
<p>“That’s the hardest thing to write,” I said. “Contradictory feeling held simultaneously.”</p>
<p>“That’s the only thing worth writing,” Charlotte said to the window.</p>
<p>We sat with that for a while. The fire was nearly out. The room was cold in a way that felt appropriate, and I did not move to fix it.</p>
<p>“The ending,” I said. “I want to talk about the ending.”</p>
<p>“No,” Charlotte said, turning from the glass. “Not yet. We haven’t earned it.”</p>
<p>“She’s right,” Waters said, and I caught the faintest flicker of surprise on Charlotte’s face — not at the agreement, but at how easily it came. “We haven’t decided the most important thing. Who possesses whom. You’ve set up a house where everyone thinks they own it — Deverell owns the house, the house owns the wife, the wife’s madness owns the narrative. But ownership is a con in itself. The person who truly possesses Harlowe is the person who understands how the con works.”</p>
<p>“The governess.”</p>
<p>“Eventually. But in the beginning, the governess is possessed by the house the same way everyone else is. She walks through it thinking she understands its architecture. She doesn’t. The house isn’t a building with a secret room. The house is a machine for producing a certain kind of woman — compliant, grateful, in love. The governess has to stop being the woman the house is designed to make before she can dismantle it.”</p>
<p>Charlotte turned from the window. “You speak of the house as though it has intent.”</p>
<p>“All houses in this kind of story have intent. You said so yourself. The corridors are arteries.”</p>
<p>“I said that was not a metaphor.”</p>
<p>“And I’m holding you to it. If the house is a body, whose body is it? Not Deverell’s — he’s a parasite, not an architect. Not the wife’s, though she lives closest to its heart. The house belongs to the idea of the house. The idea of the great English manor with its master and its secrets and its governess. The story we’ve all inherited. That’s what the governess has to escape — not the building, but the narrative it was built to contain.”</p>
<p>I looked at my notebook. I had written more than I’d realized. The room was very cold now, and somewhere in the house above us — if there was a house above us — something settled, or shifted, or breathed.</p>
<p>“There’s one more thing,” I said. “The child. Emmeline. She tells the governess, on her fourth day, that ‘Harlowe makes people cry. It gets into them.’ I want that line to do more work than it seems to.”</p>
<p>“Children in Gothic fiction always know more than they should,” Charlotte said. “It is one of the genre’s few reliable truths.”</p>
<p>“This child knows a specific thing. She knows the house is a machine because she has watched it process three governesses in a year. She’s seven. She can’t articulate what she’s observing. But she observes it.”</p>
<p>“Don’t make her wise,” Waters said sharply. “Don’t give her the knowing-child voice. Let her be seven. Let her say the true thing in a child’s language, without understanding it. ‘It gets into them’ — that’s enough. That’s better than anything an adult character could say about the same phenomenon, because it doesn’t pretend to understand.”</p>
<p>Charlotte nodded, once, the kind of nod that costs something. “The child sees. She does not comprehend. The governess comprehends but does not, at first, see. When the governess begins to see — truly see — the story turns.”</p>
<p>“And the woman upstairs?”</p>
<p>“She has always seen. She has been seeing for three years, from that warm room with its unlocked door, watching governess after governess climb the stairs and stand in the doorway and look at her with pity or horror. She is the most Gothic element in the entire story — not because she is confined, but because she is aware.”</p>
<p>The clock on the mantel, which I had not noticed before, struck something. Not an hour I recognized. The sound was flat, as if the mechanism was tired.</p>
<p>“I think we’re nearly out of fire,” I said.</p>
<p>“Good,” Charlotte said. “Stories like this should be planned in the cold.”</p>
<p>Waters capped her pen. She had not, I realized, written anything either. Whatever she was carrying out of this room, she was carrying it in her head — shapes, tensions, the architecture of a house that existed only in the negative space between what each of us had said and what we’d left unsaid.</p>
<p>“One last thing,” she said from the doorway. “The title. ‘Harlowe and Its Keeper.’ Which one is the keeper?”</p>
<p>None of us answered.</p> </section> <div class="meeting-footer" data-astro-cid-uzeevf5o> <div class="meeting-footer__nav" data-astro-cid-uzeevf5o> <a href="/read/harlowe-and-its-keeper/" class="meeting-footer__link meeting-footer__link--primary" data-astro-cid-uzeevf5o>
