Casey McQuiston arrived ten minutes late with an iced oat milk latte the size of a small fire extinguisher. I was already on my second coffee because I’d been sitting in this Cobble Hill cafe since before they opened, going over my notes, trying to figure out how to tell two writers whose sensibilities diverge at approximately the molecular level that I needed them to build something together.</p>
<p>The cafe was one of those Brooklyn places with exposed brick and a chalkboard menu and a barista with forearm tattoos who clearly recognized Casey and was trying very hard to act like she didn’t. Cat had chosen the table in the corner, the one with the worst light, and she was sitting with her back to the room in a way that suggested this was a deliberate choice. She had a notebook open but hadn’t written in it. She was watching the street through the window, where a woman in a vintage coat was walking a dog that was mostly ears.</p>
<p>“So,” Casey said, dropping into the chair across from Cat like someone falling onto a couch after a long flight. “Time travel romance. I have thoughts.”</p>
<p>“I’m sure you do,” Cat said. Not unkindly. But with the particular dryness of someone who has spent years writing romances where the obstacle is not a magical conceit but the far more devastating problem of two people who cannot say what they mean.</p>
<p>I should explain what I was trying to do. I wanted to write a love story about a woman who runs a vintage shop in Crown Heights and a woman displaced from 1945 who appears in her doorway. Time displacement as the engine of the romance. The gap between eras as the thing the characters have to cross — not just logistically but emotionally, linguistically, in the fundamental grammar of how they understand desire. I had the premise. I had the setting. What I did not have was any confidence that I could hold both registers at once: the period restraint and the contemporary exuberance. Which is why I needed both of them in the same room.</p>
<p>“I want to start with the watch,” I said.</p>
<p>Cat looked at me. She has a way of looking that makes you feel you’ve said something slightly imprecise and she’s deciding whether to correct you. “What watch?”</p>
<p>“A woman’s wristwatch. Bulova, mid-forties. Stopped at 11:47. The protagonist — the modern woman, the shop owner — finds it in an estate-sale lot. And then the woman who wore it walks through her door.”</p>
<p>“Seventy-nine years late,” Casey said. She was already smiling. She has a smile that is less an expression and more an atmospheric event. “I love it. The watch is the tether. The physical object that bridges the gap. Like the subway in — like certain other time-displacement stories.”</p>
<p>“Careful,” Cat said. “The watch can’t be a device. If it’s just a mechanism — a magic key that explains the displacement — then it’s furniture. It has to mean something about the characters. What does a stopped watch mean to a woman who sells old things for a living?”</p>
<p>This was the first real moment of the conversation. I could feel it tilt.</p>
<p>“A stopped watch is a failure,” I said. “A thing that’s supposed to keep time and doesn’t.”</p>
<p>“No.” Cat set her cortado down. “A stopped watch is a record. It’s the last moment something was alive. The hands froze at 11:47 because that’s when the mechanism failed, or the spring broke, or someone set it down and never picked it up again. That’s an archive. That’s the exact moment of loss, preserved in miniature on someone’s wrist.”</p>
<p>“Okay, but it’s also kind of romantic as hell,” Casey said. “Frozen in time? The clock stopped when she disappeared? Come on. That’s operatic.”</p>
<p>“It is operatic, and that’s the problem.” Cat was turning her coffee cup slowly on the saucer, a quarter-turn at a time, which I would later realize was exactly the gesture she was imagining for the watch. “If you play the watch as romantic — as this beautiful symbol of timeless love — you lose the grief. You lose the fact that this woman had a life that stopped. She had people she loved. She had a job and a neighborhood and friends. All of that is gone. The watch shouldn’t be romantic. It should be devastating.”</p>
<p>“It can be both,” Casey said.</p>
<p>“Can it?”</p>
<p>“That’s literally what romance is. Devastating and romantic at the same time. That’s the whole project. You find someone and it cracks you open and it’s horrible and you do it anyway because the alternative is —” She gestured with the iced latte, a sweep that encompassed the cafe, the street, Brooklyn, the concept of solitude. “The alternative is a stopped clock.”</p>
<p>Cat was quiet for a moment. I watched her process this. She did not concede verbally. She picked up her pen and wrote something in her notebook, which I later saw was a single word: <em>both</em>.</p>
<p>“Tell me about the 1945 woman,” Cat said.</p>
<p>I told them what I had. Eleanor. Late twenties. Brooklyn. Worked at the Navy Yard. A circle of women who loved women in an era that had no safe language for it. Displaced on the night the war ended — VE Day, or close to it — from a fire escape in Brooklyn Heights to a sidewalk in Crown Heights, 2024.</p>
<p>“The name is right,” Cat said. “Eleanor. It’s sturdy. It doesn’t perform.”</p>
<p>“I want her to be wearing a wool suit in August,” I said. “When she walks in. So the modern woman — Nell — knows immediately that something is off. Not just the clothes but the <em>wrongness</em> of the clothes for the weather. Period accuracy as displacement.”</p>
<p>“Yes,” Cat said. “That’s good. The body tells the truth before the voice does. In historical — in the kind of fiction I write, characters spend enormous energy managing what their bodies reveal. A woman in 1945 who loved women would have been performing constantly. Every gesture monitored. Every glance calibrated.”</p>
<p>“And then she walks into 2024 and sees two women holding hands on a subway platform,” Casey said, “and nobody looks.”</p>
<p>The table went quiet. Casey said it simply, without emphasis, and it landed hard. Cat was looking at her notebook again.</p>
<p>“That’s the scene,” Casey said. “That’s the thing that breaks her open. Not the smartphones. Not the MetroCard. It’s the casualness of it. Two women touching in public and the world just — continuing.”</p>
<p>“You’re right,” Cat said. She said it the way someone says <em>you’re right</em> when they wish they weren’t — not grudgingly, but with the specific weight of a concession that costs something. “That is the scene. But you have to be careful about how you play it. It can’t be triumphalist. It can’t be ‘look how far we’ve come.’ Because we haven’t come that far, and Eleanor wouldn’t experience it as progress. She’d experience it as loss. All the years she spent being careful, and the door was — the door could have been —”</p>
<p>“The door was always a door,” Casey said. “It was just locked from the outside.”</p>
<p>“Was it locked, though? Or did everyone just agree not to open it?”</p>
<p>I was writing as fast as I could. This was the thing I’d come for — the friction between these two sensibilities. Cat’s conviction that the closet was a material reality with material consequences, not a metaphor to be reframed; Casey’s insistence that joy and visibility are themselves acts of resistance, not naive erasures of suffering. They were both right. They were both right in ways that were fundamentally incompatible, and the incompatibility was exactly the space where this story needed to live.</p>
<p>“I want to ask about the narrator,” I said. “Nell. The modern woman. I’m imagining her as — she uses humor as a deflection mechanism. She’s self-aware about it. She’ll make a joke about her own shop’s name being an embarrassing pun in the same breath that she’s describing something that devastates her.”</p>
<p>“McQuiston energy,” Cat said, with a faint smile.</p>
<p>“I’ll take that as a compliment,” Casey said.</p>
<p>“It was intended as one. The humor is important. It can’t just be charm, though. It has to be a defense that the reader can see through. The joke is the armor. What’s underneath?”</p>
<p>“Loneliness,” I said. “She lives above the shop. She’s surrounded by other people’s old things. She’s been in love twice, both times badly, and she’s turned the wreckage into a small business.”</p>
<p>“Good. Don’t make her quirky about it,” Cat said. “The vintage-shop-owner-who’s-actually-lonely is a type. She needs to be specific. What does she <em>do</em> with her hands when she’s upset? What does she eat for breakfast? What does the shop smell like at closing time?”</p>
<p>Casey was nodding. “But also — and I mean this — let her be funny. Actually funny. Not wry-aside funny. Funny in the way people are funny when they’re terrified, when the joke is the only thing between them and the void. I want her to describe falling in love with Eleanor and call it ‘the Cat Sebastian Protocol’ or something. I want her to acknowledge that she’s writing in her journal like a Victorian governess and feel mortified about it.”</p>
<p>“You want the fourth wall to bend,” Cat said.</p>
<p>“I want the voice to feel like someone talking to you at a bar at midnight who’s three drinks in and has just realized she’s in love with a time-displaced woman from 1945 and is handling it about as well as you’d expect.”</p>
<p>I said, “Can I ask about the hidden truth? I want there to be a secret. Something one of them knows that the other doesn’t. The watch — what if the watch starts ticking again after Eleanor arrives, and Nell hides it because she’s afraid the ticking is a countdown? That if the watch runs out, Eleanor goes back?”</p>
<p>Cat sat up straighter. “That’s good. That’s very good. The deception isn’t malicious. It’s protective. She hides the watch because she’s afraid of what it means, and the hiding is simultaneously an act of love and a betrayal.”</p>
<p>“And when Eleanor finds out —”</p>
<p>“It’s not a betrayal scene,” Cat said firmly. “Don’t write the confrontation. In the kind of story I — in restrained romance, the revelation isn’t an explosion. It’s a recognition. Eleanor finds out and she understands immediately <em>why</em> Nell hid it, because Eleanor would have done the same thing. The deception doesn’t destroy trust. It reveals the depth of the fear, which is also the depth of the feeling.”</p>
<p>“I disagree,” Casey said. She said it cheerfully, which was worse. “I think Eleanor should be hurt. Not permanently. Not melodramatically. But the betrayal — even a loving one — has to sting. You can’t skip the sting just because the reader understands the motivation. Pain doesn’t care about your motivation.”</p>
<p>“I’m not saying skip it. I’m saying the pain isn’t the point. The recognition is the point.”</p>
<p>“The pain IS the recognition. Recognizing that someone you love was afraid enough to lie to you — that hurts because you understand it, not despite understanding it.”</p>
<p>I was caught between them. They were both describing the same scene and it sounded completely different from each mouth. Cat’s version was quiet — a look exchanged, a silence that says more than a speech. Casey’s version had temperature — the flush of hurt, the shaky voice, the emotional G-force of someone discovering that someone else’s fear matched their own.</p>
<p>“What if it’s both?” I said, knowing I was repeating Casey’s earlier gambit and not caring.</p>
<p>Cat gave me a look that suggested she’d noticed the repetition. “It can be both if you’re good enough to hold both registers in the same paragraph. Are you?”</p>
<p>“I don’t know,” I said. Which was true. Which is always true.</p>
<p>“Then you’ll have to try,” she said, and picked up her cortado, and I understood that this was as close to encouragement as I was going to get.</p>
<p>We talked for another hour. About the found family — Joonie from the coffee shop, Dev from the record store, Ruthie who was at Stonewall. Casey wanted them vivid and specific and warm. Cat wanted them peripheral — important but not crowding the central relationship. We compromised on something neither of them fully liked: a community that forms around Eleanor by accident, through proximity and generosity, the way communities actually form, without anyone deciding to form one.</p>
<p>We talked about the ending. This was where things got difficult.</p>
<p>“It can’t resolve,” Cat said. “The watch, the displacement, the question of whether she stays or goes — you can’t answer it. You can answer the emotional question. You can land the love story. But the mechanism, the magic, whatever brought her here — that stays open.”</p>
<p>“Readers will hate that,” Casey said.</p>
<p>“Some readers will hate it.”</p>
<p>“Most readers of romance will hate it. They want the happily ever after. They want the door closed.”</p>
<p>“Then give them the emotional door. Close that one. She stays. She loves Nell. The watch keeps ticking. But don’t explain why. Don’t make the watch a metaphor for love conquering time or whatever tidy thing a lesser version of this story would do. Let the watch be a watch. Let it tick. Let the reader sit with the not-knowing.”</p>
<p>Casey chewed on her straw for a long time. “Fine,” she said. “But the last image has to be warm. Not ambiguous-warm. Actually warm. Two people in a room together, choosing to be there. The mystery of the watch doesn’t get to undercut the certainty of the relationship.”</p>
<p>“Agreed,” Cat said, and it was the first time they’d agreed on anything without qualification, and it surprised both of them. Casey blinked. Cat wrote something else in her notebook. I didn’t see what.</p>
<p>We were running out of coffee and daylight. The barista had started giving us the particular look that means <em>we close in twenty minutes and your cups have been empty for forty</em>. Casey was telling a story about a reader who once sent her a letter describing the exact geographical coordinates where they thought a certain fictional apartment was located, and Cat was listening with the expression of someone who finds this both alarming and deeply touching, and I was thinking about hands.</p>
<p>About Eleanor’s hands, specifically. About the gloves she wore when she first walked in — kid leather, period-appropriate, the kind of gloves you wear when touching is something you manage rather than something you do. About the moment she takes them off. About what it means to a woman who spent her entire life in 1945 managing every point of physical contact with the world — to reach across a table and take someone’s hand and feel no need to look over her shoulder first.</p>
<p>“I have one more question,” I said. “About the title. I keep thinking about the address. Ainsworth Street.”</p>
<p>“Ainsworth Street doesn’t exist in Crown Heights,” Casey said.</p>
<p>“I know. I made it up.”</p>
<p>“Good,” Cat said. “Fiction should happen on fictional streets. It gives you permission to be wrong about the geography.”</p>
<p>“The stopped clock,” I said. “The stopped clock at Ainsworth Street. That’s the title.”</p>
<p>Casey frowned. “It’s melancholy.”</p>
<p>“It’s accurate,” Cat said.</p>
<p>“It’s melancholy and accurate,” I said. “Which is where we started.”</p>
<p>Cat closed her notebook. Casey finished her latte with the particular determination of someone extracting the last molecule of oat milk through a straw. Outside, the light on Smith Street had gone gold the way Brooklyn light goes gold in the late afternoon, when the buildings catch the sun at exactly the right angle and everything looks, briefly, like it exists inside an old photograph.</p>
<p>“One thing,” Casey said, standing up, pulling on her jacket. “The scene where Eleanor sees the two women on the subway platform. Don’t narrate it from Eleanor’s perspective. Have Nell watch Eleanor watching them. The displacement is in the witnessing, not the event.”</p>
<p>Cat looked at her. Something passed between them that I couldn’t read — not agreement, not disagreement, but the particular silence of one writer recognizing that another writer has said something she wishes she’d said first.</p>
<p>“That’s exactly right,” Cat said.</p>
<p>Casey grinned. “Write that down.”</p>
