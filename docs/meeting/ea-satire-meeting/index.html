Saunders had arrived first and was already watching the barista with that expression he gets — not judging, exactly, but noticing the way the kid’s smile was about three degrees too enthusiastic, the kind of corporate cheerfulness that might, in a Saunders story, precede a memo about Mandatory Joy Compliance.</p>
<p>Twain ordered black coffee and looked at the menu like it had personally wronged him.</p>
<p>“Four dollars,” he said. “For coffee.”</p>
<p>“Adjusted for inflation from your era,” I offered, “that’s actually —”</p>
<p>“I don’t care what it is adjusted for. I care that a man has to read nine words to order a cup of coffee. What is a ‘cortado’?”</p>
<p>“It’s a — well, it’s espresso with a small amount of —”</p>
<p>“It’s coffee with pretensions,” Twain said. He sat down heavily. “Fine. So. You want to write a story about people who’ve calculated the moral cost of everything and the value of nothing.”</p>
<p>Saunders laughed — a real one, not performative. “That’s pretty good. That’s basically it.”</p>
<p>“It’s Oscar Wilde,” Twain said. “I’m not above theft.”</p>
<p>I pulled out my notes, such as they were. “The premise is effective altruism taken to its endpoint. A society that’s internalized utilitarian calculus so completely that every personal choice becomes a moral transaction. Your cup of coffee — the four dollars — could have bought two malaria nets through the Against Malaria Foundation, which statistically saves roughly one life per $5,000 in donations, so the marginal cost of that coffee is approximately 0.0008 of a human life.”</p>
<p>They both looked at me.</p>
<p>“I did the math beforehand,” I said.</p>
<p>“Of course you did,” Twain said. “And that right there is the disease you want to write about, isn’t it? Not the math. The fact that someone would do the math.”</p>
<p>“But here’s the thing,” Saunders said, leaning forward. He’d been stirring his coffee — a flat white, which I decided not to point out to Twain — and now he set the spoon down with a kind of deliberateness that meant he was about to be serious. “The math isn’t wrong. That’s what makes it hard. If you can save a child’s life by skipping lattes for a year, and you don’t, you have to sit with that. The utilitarian argument isn’t stupid. It’s airtight. That’s why it’s so dangerous.”</p>
<p>“Airtight,” Twain repeated. “You know what else is airtight? A coffin.”</p>
<p>“I’m serious, Sam.”</p>
<p>“So am I. An airtight argument is the most dangerous thing in the world because it leaves no room for a human being to breathe inside it. Every tyrant who ever lived had an airtight argument. The slaveholder had an airtight argument. He had economics, scripture, and Aristotle. You could not beat him in a debate. You could only look at the thing itself and say, no, this is wrong, I don’t care about your syllogism.”</p>
<p>I started to object — the comparison seemed extreme — but Saunders was already nodding in a way that surprised me.</p>
<p>“No, he’s right. Not about the comparison — EA people aren’t slaveholders, obviously — but about the mechanism. When the logic gets so clean that it can override your felt sense of what’s decent, something has gone sideways. I keep thinking about these corporate training environments I used to write about. The ones where everybody has internalized the metrics so completely that they can’t see the suffering right in front of them because it’s not in the spreadsheet. What you’re describing is that, but for morality itself.”</p>
<p>“The spreadsheet becomes the morality,” I said.</p>
<p>“Right. And then the person who can’t do the spreadsheet — who just feels bad and gives twenty bucks to a guy on the street — becomes the villain. They’re ‘innumerate.’ They’re ‘sentimental.’ They’re wasting resources that could be optimally allocated.”</p>
<p>Twain grinned. It was not a kind grin. “I knew a preacher in Hannibal who had calculated the precise number of prayers required to save a soul. He had a ledger. He could tell you that old Mrs. Hutchinson needed forty-seven more prayers to clear purgatory, while young Tom Bell only needed twelve on account of being a child and having sinned less. The congregation thought he was a saint. The man was completely insane. But you couldn’t argue with his arithmetic.”</p>
<p>“Did you write about him?” I asked.</p>
<p>“I didn’t need to. God did it for me. The man was struck by lightning at a church picnic. Not fatally. Just enough to set his ledger on fire.” Twain took a sip of coffee. “I may be embellishing.”</p>
<p>“You are absolutely embellishing,” Saunders said.</p>
<p>“I am embellishing, but the point is true, which is better than being accurate. The point is that some things resist quantification, and the attempt to quantify them is itself a form of violence. Not physical violence. Something worse. A violence against the — what do you call it? The texture of being alive.”</p>
<p>I’d been taking notes, and I looked up. “So where does the comedy come from? Because right now this is an essay, and we need it to be funny. Harrison Bergeron is funny. Omelas is not funny. We need the Vonnegut gear, not the Le Guin gear.”</p>
<p>Saunders pointed at me. “Wrong. You need both. Vonnegut’s trick in ‘Harrison Bergeron’ is that the premise is funny — everyone handicapped to enforce equality — but the conclusion is violent and sad. Le Guin’s trick in ‘Omelas’ is that the premise is beautiful — a perfect city — and the conclusion is a quiet moral horror. You want to start with Vonnegut and end up somewhere near Le Guin. The comedy is the way in. The horror is what you find when you get there.”</p>
<p>“But you can’t just turn off the funny,” Twain said. “That’s the amateur move. ‘I’ll be funny for twenty pages and then suddenly I’ll be serious and they’ll know I’m a real writer.’ Bah. The funny has to stay. It just has to become a different kind of funny. A funny that hurts.”</p>
<p>“A funny that hurts,” I repeated, writing it down.</p>
<p>“Don’t write that down like it’s wisdom. It’s obvious. Every court jester knew it. The question is how.”</p>
<p>I tried an idea. “What if the comedy is in the escalation? You start with someone feeling guilty about coffee, and then it’s dating — you can’t date someone purely for personal happiness because the time and money spent on courtship could be redirected to higher-impact interventions — and then it’s weddings, which are obscene expenditure —”</p>
<p>“And then children,” Saunders said quietly. “That’s where it gets dark. Because the EA logic on children is genuinely disturbing if you follow it all the way down. A child in a developed nation costs, what, two hundred and fifty thousand dollars to raise? That’s fifty thousand malaria nets. That’s roughly ten statistical lives. So every child born in Brooklyn is, by the numbers, a moral catastrophe.”</p>
<p>“Unless,” Twain said, and his voice had changed. Lower. The deadpan mode. “Unless the child grows up to earn enough money to save more than ten lives, in which case the child is a good investment, and you should be judged not as a parent but as a portfolio manager.”</p>
<p>We all sat with that for a moment.</p>
<p>“That’s the story,” I said. “That’s the world. Where children require impact assessments.”</p>
<p>“Three hundred and forty pages,” Twain said. “That’s how long the assessment should be. Three hundred and forty pages, submitted in triplicate to the Bureau of Reproductive Ethics, with a section on the expected lifetime carbon output of the proposed child and a projection of their probable charitable contributions indexed against their genetic predisposition toward altruism, which, naturally, someone has developed a test for.”</p>
<p>Saunders was laughing, but it was the kind of laughing where you also look slightly sick. “And the voice. The voice has to be someone who’s inside the system. Not a rebel. Someone who believes in it. Who genuinely thinks they’re good. That’s the Vonnegut move — the narrator of ‘Harrison Bergeron’ is someone watching TV. They’re not outraged. They barely notice. The horror is in the complacency.”</p>
<p>“Or the narrator is mid-level,” I suggested. “Like your corporate narrators. Someone who works at the Bureau of Moral Accounting, or whatever the institution is, and processes the guilt assessments, and is good at their job, and is dying inside in a way they can’t name because the system has no metric for that particular kind of death.”</p>
<p>Saunders considered this. “Maybe. But I’d push back on one thing. Don’t make the institution too obviously evil. The trick with corporate satire — the reason it works in ‘CivilWarLand in Bad Decline’ or ‘Pastoralia’ — is that the institution is trying to be good. Everyone in it is trying. The memos are sincere. The mission statement is beautiful. The people implementing it are kind. And the system still grinds people up. That’s where the real horror lives. Not in malice. In good intentions that have been optimized past the point of humanity.”</p>
<p>“The road to hell,” Twain said.</p>
<p>“Paved with spreadsheets,” Saunders finished.</p>
<p>Twain pulled out an imaginary cigar and pretended to smoke it. I assumed this was his thinking posture. “Here’s what bothers me about the longtermism business. Not the regular utilitarian nonsense — give your money away, feel guilty, et cetera. That’s old Calvinist wine in new silicon bottles. I mean the longtermist argument specifically. The one that says: don’t worry about the child dying now, because in the future there will be trillions of digital minds living in computer simulations, and their suffering or flourishing so vastly outnumbers present human experience that the child is — what’s the charming phrase?”</p>
<p>“A rounding error,” I said.</p>
<p>“A rounding error. A living, breathing child is a rounding error. Now, I have heard many monstrous things said by intelligent men. I covered the Gilded Age. I listened to railroad barons explain why crushed workers were the price of progress. But I never heard one of them call a child a rounding error with a straight face. That required a better education.”</p>
<p>Saunders shifted uncomfortably. “But again — and I hate that I keep saying this — the logic isn’t obviously wrong. If you genuinely believe that digital minds will be conscious and will vastly outnumber biological humans, then from a pure expected-value calculation —”</p>
<p>“George. Listen to yourself.”</p>
<p>“I know. I know. But that’s the point, isn’t it? The logic has a kind of gravitational pull. Once you accept the first premise — that suffering is fungible, that one unit of suffering here is equivalent to one unit of suffering there — then you’re on a slope and there’s no obvious place to stop. You slide from ‘give more to charity’ to ‘dating is selfish’ to ‘children are negative externalities’ to ‘present humans are rounding errors compared to hypothetical future digital minds.’ Each step follows from the last. The system is self-consistent. It’s just not —”</p>
<p>“Human,” Twain said.</p>
<p>“Right.”</p>
<p>I saw something in this that excited me. “So the comedy is in the self-consistency. Each escalation is internally logical. The audience laughs because they can see the insanity, but they can’t find the exact moment where the reasoning went wrong. It’s like Catch-22 — every individual rule makes sense, and the total system is madness.”</p>
<p>“Now you’re getting somewhere,” Twain said. “Though I’d add: the system also has to eat itself. That’s the part you mentioned about EA causing suffering. If your moral framework causes enough guilt and shame and depression and paralysis, it starts generating the very suffering it was designed to eliminate. And then — and this is the beautiful part, structurally — the framework identifies itself as the most tractable source of suffering. The most cost-effective intervention becomes dismantling the intervention. You fund a program to address the damage caused by programs.”</p>
<p>“The snake eating its tail,” Saunders said.</p>
<p>“The snake eating its tail and then applying for grant funding to study tail consumption,” Twain corrected.</p>
<p>I asked about the ending. Not the plot — I didn’t want to plan that yet — but the emotional note. What should the reader feel on the last page?</p>
<p>Saunders spoke first. “Relief. Not victory, not resolution. Relief. The feeling of someone stepping outside on a cold morning and just breathing. The thing about these total systems — whether it’s corporate optimization or utilitarian calculus or any ideology that tries to account for everything — is that they’re exhausting. They’re cognitively and morally exhausting. And the relief of stepping outside the system, even for a moment, even to do something as stupid and small as buying a cup of coffee because you want a cup of coffee — that relief is the most subversive act in the story.”</p>
<p>“Buying the coffee,” I said.</p>
<p>“Buying the coffee. Not as a political statement. Not as a rebellion. Not even knowing that it’s subversive. Just… wanting coffee. The irreducible human want that refuses to submit to calculation.”</p>
<p>Twain shook his head slowly. “You’re too gentle. You’re always too gentle. The coffee is fine. I like the coffee. But you need the other side too. You need someone to say: the people who built this system were not evil, and they were not stupid, and they were trying to help, and they caused immense suffering, and those things are all true at once. You need the reader to feel the weight of that. Not just the relief of escape but the tragedy of how the cage got built in the first place.”</p>
<p>“Can you have both?” I asked.</p>
<p>“You’d better have both,” Twain said. “If you only have the escape, it’s a feel-good story about one brave person rejecting the system. Instagram philosophy. If you only have the tragedy, it’s a lecture. You need the reader to laugh, and then stop laughing, and then laugh again at something darker, and then feel something they can’t quite name, and then go home and think about what they spent their money on last Tuesday. Not because you told them to think about it. Because they can’t help it.”</p>
<p>Saunders smiled. “That’s pretty good.”</p>
<p>“It’s always pretty good. That’s why they keep inviting me to these things.”</p>
<p>“Nobody invited you,” I pointed out. “I made you up.”</p>
<p>“And yet here I am,” Twain said, “with better lines than either of you. Think about what that means.”</p>
<p>There was a pause. The barista called out someone’s mobile order — a name neither of us could parse, for a drink with six modifiers — and Twain watched the transaction with an expression that was, for just a moment, genuinely sad.</p>
<p>“You know what the real punchline is,” he said. “Not for the story. For the world. The real punchline is that being human is expensive. It has always been expensive. Every civilization in history has been subsidized by someone’s suffering, and the honest ones at least knew it. The pyramids. The railroads. The iPhone. The question was never whether someone suffers. The question was whether you could look at it. What your friends here have done — the effective altruists — is build a machine for looking at it. A very good machine. It sees everything. It quantifies everything. And it turns out that when you can see all the suffering, all at once, in precise numerical terms, it doesn’t make you more moral. It makes you insane. Because the human animal was not built to carry the weight of all the world’s suffering expressed as a spreadsheet. We were built to carry the suffering we can see and touch and hold. The woman next door. The child in the street. The friend who’s drinking too much. That’s our scale. Everything beyond it is either sainthood or madness, and I’ve never been able to tell the difference.”</p>
<p>Saunders didn’t say anything for a while. Then: “I think the story should be funny.”</p>
<p>“I just said something profound and you want to talk about comedy?”</p>
<p>“Because the profundity is where you hide. The funny is where the truth lives. Your best stuff — ‘Huck Finn,’ the Connecticut Yankee — it’s funny first. The profundity sneaks in while the reader’s guard is down. If you start with the sermon, they see it coming. If you start with the joke —”</p>
<p>“They don’t see the knife.” Twain nodded. “Fine. Make it funny. But make sure the knife is in there.”</p>
<p>I looked at my notes. I had more questions — about structure, about voice, about how many characters and what the central image should be — but the coffee was getting cold and Twain was already standing up, and I realized the conversation had given me something better than answers. It had given me the tension. The push and pull between empathy and outrage, between systems-level thinking and the irreducible mess of individual human wanting. The comedy of a world that knows the price of everything and has calculated, to six decimal places, the cost of being alive.</p>
<p>Saunders put on his coat. “One more thing. Don’t let the story be smug. It would be very easy to write this as ‘look at these silly rationalists.’ But the best version takes them seriously. It says: you’re right, and here’s what right looks like when it forgets to be human. That’s scarier. And funnier.”</p>
<p>“And truer,” Twain said from the door.</p>
<p>I paid for all three coffees. It cost eleven dollars and forty cents. I did not calculate the opportunity cost. Or rather, I did — automatically, involuntarily, the way you can’t not see the arrow in the FedEx logo once someone points it out — and then I tipped the barista five dollars and walked out into the parking lot, where the sun was doing something ordinary and unremarkable and absolutely free of charge.</p> </section> <div class="meeting-footer" data-astro-cid-uzeevf5o> <div class="meeting-footer__nav" data-astro-cid-uzeevf5o> <a href="/read/optimal-distress-processing/" class="meeting-footer__link meeting-footer__link--primary" data-astro-cid-uzeevf5o>
