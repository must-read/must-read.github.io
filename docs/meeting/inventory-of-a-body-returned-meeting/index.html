Lovecraft and Carmen Maria Machado</p> <time datetime="2026-02-21" data-astro-cid-uzeevf5o>February 21, 2026</time> <hr class="header-divider" data-astro-cid-uzeevf5o> </header> <section class="reading-content" data-astro-cid-uzeevf5o> <p>The room was wrong. Not dramatically wrong — not tilted, not bleeding, not impossibly shaped. Wrong in the way a photograph of your own house looks wrong when someone else takes it. The proportions were fine. The furniture was fine. The fluorescent light above the table hummed at a frequency that sat just below hearing, more felt than perceived, a pressure behind the eyes. I had been here for twenty minutes before either of them arrived, and in those twenty minutes I had moved my chair three times without understanding why. I kept feeling like I was sitting too close to a wall that wasn’t there.</p>
<p>Lovecraft arrived first. He was taller than I expected, and narrower, as though someone had built a man for the sole purpose of looking uncomfortable in a doorway. He surveyed the room with an expression I can only describe as <em>suspicious caution</em> — the face of a man who trusts neither the room nor his own judgment of it. He sat across from me, placed his hands flat on the table, and said nothing for a while.</p>
<p>“The table is adequate,” he said finally. I think this was a compliment.</p>
<p>Machado came in like weather. I don’t mean she was loud or dramatic. I mean the air changed. She had a canvas bag slung over one shoulder and a coffee in a paper cup and she looked at Lovecraft the way you look at a locked door you intend to open. She sat down next to me, not across — close enough that I could smell her coffee and something warmer underneath, like cinnamon, like skin.</p>
<p>“So,” she said. “We’re writing about a body.”</p>
<p>“We are writing,” Lovecraft corrected, in a voice that made every syllable sound individually considered and found barely tolerable, “about what happens to a mind — a human consciousness — when confronted with evidence that its existence is incidental. A footnote in a cosmological process so vast that the word ‘vast’ is itself an insult to the scale.”</p>
<p>“Right. A body.”</p>
<p>I laughed. I shouldn’t have. Lovecraft gave me a look that could have curdled milk at a hundred yards.</p>
<p>“The two are not equivalent,” he said.</p>
<p>“That’s exactly the problem,” Machado said. She set her coffee down with a kind of deliberate care. “You’ve spent your entire career writing about the horror of knowledge — what it does to the <em>mind</em> to encounter something beyond comprehension. And that’s real. I’m not dismissing it. But you skip the body every time. Your narrators go mad, they gibber, they scrawl desperate warnings. They never mention what it feels like in their stomach. They never throw up. They never get an erection.”</p>
<p>The silence that followed this was architectural. You could have stored things in it.</p>
<p>“The body,” Lovecraft said carefully, “is the vessel. It is not the subject.”</p>
<p>“The body is always the subject. We live in them. We die in them. Horror that doesn’t touch the body is just philosophy.”</p>
<p>I should have said something here — I was supposed to be a participant, not an audience — but I was pinned between them like a moth between glass slides. Machado was right. But Lovecraft was also right. Cosmic horror operates at a scale where the individual body should be irrelevant, and yet the reason it terrifies is that <em>we have bodies</em>. We are the small, warm, local thing that the vast, cold, indifferent thing threatens to render meaningless. Without the body, there’s no stakes. Just astronomy.</p>
<p>“I think,” I said, and they both looked at me, “what if the body <em>is</em> the site of the cosmic? Not just the thing that gets destroyed by the encounter, but the medium through which the encounter happens?”</p>
<p>Lovecraft frowned. Machado tilted her head.</p>
<p>“Go on,” she said.</p>
<p>“An Antarctic expedition. Something found in the ice — not a creature, not a ruin, but a structure. A pattern. Something that’s been frozen for a million years, waiting for a biological receiver. And the receiver is a human body. A specific human body. The horror isn’t that she saw something terrible. The horror is that something terrible moved into her. Through her skin. Through her cells. Through her—”</p>
<p>“Through her what?” Machado asked. She was leaning forward now.</p>
<p>“Through whatever it is that makes a body a <em>body</em> instead of just organized matter.”</p>
<p>“That is precisely the sort of sentimentality,” Lovecraft said, “that renders horror toothless. The power of the cosmic resides in its absolute indifference to individual form. You are proposing that it has a <em>relationship</em> with one body. That it has chosen. That reduces the cosmic to the personal. It domesticates it.”</p>
<p>“Unless,” Machado said, and her voice had gone quiet, the way it does when she’s working through something, “the domestication is the horror. The cosmic doesn’t choose her. The cosmic doesn’t even know what choosing is. It’s a signal that’s been broadcasting for geological time, and her body happens to be tuned to the right frequency. The way a radio doesn’t choose a station — the station is just <em>there</em>, on the wavelength, and when you turn the dial—”</p>
<p>“The cosmic as broadcast.” Lovecraft was quiet for a moment. “That is… not entirely without merit.”</p>
<p>From him, this was practically an ovation.</p>
<p>“But the body,” he insisted. “You want the body to be central. The physical form, the meat of it. I find this repellant. Not on moral grounds — on aesthetic ones. The horror of the infinite should make the body <em>disappear</em>. The whole point is that we do not matter. That our forms, our desires, our precious individual experiences are less than dust.”</p>
<p>“And yet your narrators always survive long enough to write it down,” Machado said. “Every single time. They matter enough to record. Their bodies matter enough to hold the pen. You can’t escape the body even in your own fiction, Howard. You just refuse to look at it.”</p>
<p>She used his first name the way you use a key — to open something he’d rather keep locked.</p>
<p>“I want the narrator to be a woman,” she continued. “A scientist. A microbiologist — someone who understands bodies professionally, who has spent her career studying the boundaries of living systems. And the body that gets changed, the one that comes back from the ice carrying the signal — I want it to be her wife’s body. A body she knows. A body she’s been touching for years. That’s where the horror is. Not in the abstraction. In the specific. The exact texture of a changed tongue.”</p>
<p>Lovecraft’s mouth thinned. I could see him processing the word <em>wife</em> — not the queerness of it, exactly, or not only that, but the intimacy. The suggestion that cosmic horror might live in a bed. In a kitchen. In the space between two people who love each other and one of them is becoming something else.</p>
<p>“You want to reduce the cosmic to a domestic drama,” he said.</p>
<p>“I want to put the cosmic <em>inside</em> a domestic drama and see which one breaks first.”</p>
<p>I said, “What if it’s a list?”</p>
<p>They both looked at me again.</p>
<p>“An inventory. The narrator is trying to contain what’s happened by cataloguing it. The skin. The eyes. The sleep patterns. The way her wife tastes. She’s a scientist — her instinct when confronted with the incomprehensible is to <em>observe and record</em>. To make a list. To impose the discipline of cataloguing on something that resists cataloguing. And the horror is that the list keeps growing, and the categories start breaking down, and the act of cataloguing becomes its own kind of madness.”</p>
<p>Machado sat back. She was smiling, but it wasn’t a comfortable smile. It was the smile of someone who has just recognized something she’d been circling for years.</p>
<p>“The inventory as form,” she said. “I’ve used it. The list as a way of approaching horror sideways. You can’t narrate the worst thing that ever happened to you, but you can list the contents of the room where it happened. You can list the clothes you were wearing. The form creates distance, and the distance is what lets you get closer to the thing you can’t face directly.”</p>
<p>“The list also fails,” Lovecraft said, and I was surprised — not that he spoke, but that he spoke with something approaching enthusiasm. “The list imposes order. Numbering. Sequence. Hierarchy. And the cosmic <em>has no hierarchy</em>. If you number the changes — skin first, eyes second, sleep third — you imply a progression. A narrative. But the thing itself, the signal, the ancient structure — it does not progress. It simply is. The list, by its very structure, lies about what it describes.”</p>
<p>“Yes,” Machado said. “And the narrator knows the list is lying. And she keeps listing anyway. Because what else can she do?”</p>
<p>For a moment we all sat with that. The fluorescent light buzzed. Outside, somewhere far away and underneath us, something settled. Probably the building’s foundation. Probably.</p>
<p>“I want the warmth,” Machado said. “The body that comes back from the ice should be warm. Impossibly warm. Not feverish — her temperature reads normal. But when you touch her, the heat comes from somewhere deeper than anatomy can explain. Like pressing yourself against a furnace that extends down through the floor. The wife notices it immediately, in the hotel room in Christchurch, when she undresses her for the first time in seven months.”</p>
<p>“Christchurch,” Lovecraft repeated.</p>
<p>“The gateway city for Antarctic expeditions. Where the planes leave from.”</p>
<p>“I know what Christchurch is. I am merely noting that the intimacy of the scene — the undressing, the hotel room, the seven months of longing — strikes me as incongruous with the scale of what you propose.”</p>
<p>“It’s not incongruous. It’s the <em>mechanism</em>. The signal passes from one body to another through intimacy. Through touch. Through sex. Not because the signal is predatory — not because it targets desire. Because desire is a frequency. Because when two bodies that know each other open to each other, the channels are already built. The signal just rides them.”</p>
<p>Lovecraft was quiet for a long time. When he spoke, his voice was different. Smaller.</p>
<p>“You are suggesting that love is the vector.”</p>
<p>“I’m suggesting that love is <em>a</em> vector. Along with skin contact, saliva, proximity, time. But yes. The deepest transmission happens through the deepest intimacy. And the narrator knows this. She knows that every time she touches her wife, she’s being rewritten. And she keeps touching her.”</p>
<p>“Because she loves her,” I said.</p>
<p>“Because she loves her. And because — this is important — because part of her wants it. Part of her wants to be rewritten. Not the cosmic part. Not the grand indifferent signal from before the Earth cooled. The part where her wife is inside her, changing her, and the boundary between them is dissolving, and that dissolution is terrifying and also — also — it’s what love does. It’s what intimacy always does. You let someone change you. You become permeable. The cosmic just takes it further than the body can survive.”</p>
<p>I felt something shift in my chest. Not the signal — there was no signal, we were in a badly lit room having a conversation about a story that didn’t exist yet. But the idea had weight. Physical weight. The horror of loving someone who is becoming something else, and not being able to stop touching them, because love and horror were using the same nerves.</p>
<p>“The ending,” Lovecraft said. “She must go to the water. The wife. She must walk east, toward the coast. The signal originates from the deep structures of the planet — the ice was merely storage, a medium — and the water is where it concentrates. She leaves. The narrator stays. But not for long.”</p>
<p>“How do you know?” Machado asked.</p>
<p>“Because the narrator is already changed. The fingerprints, the moles, the taste that lives beneath taste. The inventory is not merely a record of the wife’s transformation. It is, by the time we reach the final entries, a confession that the narrator is transforming too. The list becomes self-portrait.”</p>
<p>“She goes east,” Machado said. “At the end. She decides to follow.”</p>
<p>“Does she?” I asked. “Or does she just stop resisting?”</p>
<p>Neither of them answered. Machado picked up her coffee, found it cold, set it down again. Lovecraft was looking at the table, tracing something on its surface with one long finger. I tried not to look at what he was tracing.</p>
<p>“The dog,” Machado said suddenly. “There should be a dog. A dog named Pilot who stares east and won’t eat and whose eyes are going deep. The signal doesn’t discriminate between species. Why would it? It’s not interested in species. It’s interested in biology. In anything warm enough to transmit.”</p>
<p>“Pilot,” Lovecraft said. “After the Bronte dog.”</p>
<p>“After whatever you like. The dog is warm against her leg and she knows what the warmth means and she doesn’t move away.”</p>
<p>“A sentimental detail.”</p>
<p>“A devastating one. There’s a difference. You can tell which is which by whether it costs the writer something to put it on the page.”</p>
<p>The fluorescent light flickered. Just once. When it came back, the room’s proportions had not changed, but my sense of them had — the walls seemed farther away, or the space between us seemed to contain more of itself than it should. Lovecraft noticed too. I saw his hands go flat on the table.</p>
<p>“The thing in the ice,” he said. “It should not be biological. Not geological. Not technological. It should be <em>expressed</em> — like a gene is expressed. The ice is the medium. The structure is what happens when you provide the medium and the signal has been broadcasting for a million years. A cross-section of a single thread in a network that extends through cubic kilometers. The entire ice sheet is a motherboard and the drill core is a splinter of one circuit.”</p>
<p>“And she puts her hand on it,” Machado said. “And it’s warm.”</p>
<p>“And it’s warm,” Lovecraft agreed. He sounded defeated. He sounded like a man who had just conceded that the body matters and hadn’t forgiven himself for it.</p>
<p>“I have a question,” I said. “The institute. The people who come to the house in dark suits with credentials from no known agency. Dr. Ashworth. She tells the narrator that the wife is becoming a transmitter. A radio tower. But she also says <em>proximity is a factor</em>. And then she asks how close the narrator has been to her wife since she returned. And the narrator says, ‘Close. We’re married.’ And Ashworth closes her eyes.”</p>
<p>“What’s the question?” Machado asked.</p>
<p>“Is the institute trying to help? Or are they watching? Is Ashworth’s reaction pity, or is it data collection?”</p>
<p>They looked at each other — Lovecraft and Machado, two writers with almost nothing in common except the belief that the universe does not owe you an explanation.</p>
<p>“Both,” Machado said.</p>
<p>“Neither,” Lovecraft said. “The institute is irrelevant. A human institution attempting to administer a geological process. They are as meaningful as a flea studying the dog it rides.”</p>
<p>“They’re meaningful to the narrator. She could call Ashworth. She could let them study her. She could drive west, away from the water. She has the card. She has the number. And she chooses east.”</p>
<p>“Because she loves her wife.”</p>
<p>“Because she loves her wife. Because the signal doesn’t care, and she does, and caring is the last human thing she has, and she’d rather carry it into the incomprehensible than let it go.”</p>
<p>The light buzzed. Lovecraft was still tracing on the table. I looked down. The marks his finger left were invisible to the eye, but I could feel them — a faint warmth in the wood, like a circuit completing.</p>
<p>“One more thing,” Machado said. She was looking at me now, not at Lovecraft. “The wedding ring. She leaves it behind. White gold. Inscribed <em>para sempre</em>. ‘Forever.’ Because forever means something different now. It used to mean a human lifetime. Now it means geological time. And the ring is too small for what forever has become.”</p>
<p>Nobody said anything to that. We sat in the buzzing room and the walls held their distance and the table was warm under our hands and I thought about writing this story — about whether I could hold the cosmic and the intimate in the same sentence, the ice sheet and the kitchen table, the signal that has been broadcasting since before the Earth cooled and the woman who keeps reaching for the wrong coffee mug.</p>
<p>Lovecraft stood to leave. At the door he paused.</p>
<p>“The tears,” he said, without turning around. “When the wife weeps while eating the orange. The tears leave marks on the narrator’s shirt. Branching patterns. Like the structures in the ice, scaled to the size of teardrops.” He seemed to struggle with something. “That is… an effective detail.”</p>
<p>The door closed behind him. Machado finished her cold coffee.</p>
<p>“He’ll never admit it,” she said. “But the body is how the cosmic gets in. It’s always been how it gets in. Through the skin. Through the mouth. Through the space between two people who love each other enough to be permeable. The signal doesn’t need a mind to enter. It just needs a body that’s already open.”</p>
<p>She picked up her bag. At the door she paused too.</p>
<p>“Make the list break down,” she said. “Start clinical. End with the narrator’s hand on the table where the growth is spreading, feeling for her wife in the warmth. The form dissolves because the narrator dissolves. The inventory becomes a love letter becomes a suicide note becomes something that doesn’t have a genre.”</p>
<p>She left. I sat in the room with the buzzing light and the warm table and the faint smell of cold coffee and I thought about the story. About the body as inventory. About the inventory as form. About the form as a container for something that cannot be contained.</p>
<p>My hand was on the table. The table was warm.</p>
<p>I pulled my hand away.</p> </section> <div class="meeting-footer" data-astro-cid-uzeevf5o> <div class="meeting-footer__nav" data-astro-cid-uzeevf5o> <a href="/read/inventory-of-a-body-returned/" class="meeting-footer__link meeting-footer__link--primary" data-astro-cid-uzeevf5o>
