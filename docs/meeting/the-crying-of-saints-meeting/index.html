Too cold, too clean — one of those places in Bogotá with exposed brick and pour-over coffee and a barista who looked personally offended when García Márquez asked for tinto, just tinto, the kind that has been sitting in a thermos since six in the morning and tastes vaguely of the pot it was made in. Roy was drinking chai she had brought in a thermos of her own, which she unscrewed without apology, filling the table with a smell of cardamom and condensed milk that made the barista’s nostrils flare like a horse scenting fire.</p>
<p>I had a notebook open. I had been making notes. I stopped making notes about forty minutes in because the conversation had left me behind in a way that felt less like being abandoned and more like being carried past my stop on a bus — the scenery was still interesting, but I no longer knew where I was.</p>
<p>“The problem with fertility as a subject,” García Márquez was saying, and he said <em>subject</em> the way you might say <em>weather</em> — as something that simply was, that required no justification — “is that everyone thinks it is about wanting. A woman wants a child. This is the engine. But wanting is boring. Wanting is what Americans write about. The interesting thing is what happens when the wanting works.”</p>
<p>“The interesting thing,” Roy said, “is what the wanting costs.”</p>
<p>“No. Cost is aftermath. I am talking about the moment of working. The instant when the prayer — or the spell, or the ritual, whatever this thing is — actually functions. Because the question no one ever asks is: what does it mean for the universe to say yes? When you ask for something impossible and the impossible agrees, what has just happened? What contract have you signed?”</p>
<p>I said something about the Faustian, which I regretted immediately.</p>
<p>“Faust is European,” García Márquez said, not unkindly. “Faust is a man who wants knowledge and trades his soul for it. Very clean. Very Protestant. A transaction. What I am describing is not a transaction. It is a — ” He paused. He picked up his tinto, looked into it, and set it down without drinking. “When my grandmother told me about the woman in Aracataca who could make it rain by boiling herbs in a particular order, she did not describe it as a deal with the devil. She described it as a talent. Like singing, or knowing when the corn was ready. Some women could do it. The rain came because it recognized them.”</p>
<p>“But it still cost something,” Roy said. She had both hands wrapped around her thermos cap, which she used as a cup. Her fingers were long and the nails were short and unpolished and she held the cup the way you hold something alive. “The woman in Aracataca — what happened to her?”</p>
<p>“She went blind.”</p>
<p>“So.”</p>
<p>“She went blind for other reasons.”</p>
<p>“Did she.”</p>
<p>García Márquez smiled. It was the smile of a man who has been caught and does not mind because the catching was well done. “Perhaps the blindness and the rain were related. But my grandmother never said so. She told them as two separate facts about the same woman. The rain and the blindness lived in the same person but not in the same story.”</p>
<p>“That is exactly what I distrust about the way magic works in — forgive me — in your tradition.” Roy set down the thermos cap. A ring of milky chai remained on the table like a small halo. “The magic arrives, and it is beautiful, and it is told beautifully, and the sentence that contains it is so perfect that you forget to ask what it did to the body. I am always asking what it did to the body. Because magic that does not cost the body anything is decoration.”</p>
<p>I could feel the disagreement tightening. Not hostility — something more useful than that. A pressure. Like two weather systems meeting.</p>
<p>“I resist this,” García Márquez said. He said it slowly. “I resist the idea that every extraordinary thing must extract a physical toll. You are describing a universe that punishes wonder. My universe does not punish wonder. My universe finds wonder ordinary.”</p>
<p>“And my universe finds ordinariness full of wonder, which is a different project entirely.” Roy turned to me. “What are these sisters like? Whose bodies are we in?”</p>
<p>I told her what I had so far. Three sisters in a house above Popayán. The house has been settling for two centuries. The grandmother left a notebook — a fertility ritual involving midnight rain and the tears of saints.</p>
<p>“Actual tears,” García Márquez said. “From plaster saints. Warm. They taste of copper.”</p>
<p>“Why copper?” Roy asked.</p>
<p>“Because tears should not taste like water. Water is nothing. Copper is the taste of blood that isn’t blood. It is the body’s mineral signature.”</p>
<p>Roy nodded — slowly, reluctantly, the way you nod when someone says something you wish you had said. “Fine. Copper. But tell me about the mud.”</p>
<p>I hadn’t mentioned mud.</p>
<p>“There will be mud,” she said. “If a woman is standing barefoot in a courtyard in the Colombian highlands at midnight, there is mud between her toes. And the mud matters. Not because it’s symbolic — I don’t care about symbolism, symbolism is what happens when writers are afraid to describe things — but because the mud is the interface. Between her body and the ground. Between what she wants and what the earth will or will not give.”</p>
<p>“The mud will have the color of old blood,” García Márquez said, as though this were not a decision but a memory. “Because the earth in the Cauca Valley has iron in it, and the iron turns the mud red, and this red is the red of things that have already happened. Not fresh blood. Not new. The red of an event that is finished but that the ground has not forgotten.”</p>
<p>“Yes,” Roy said. “And it will work between her toes like fingers.”</p>
<p>They looked at each other. Something had passed between them — not agreement, exactly, but a shared recognition of the same image arriving from different directions. García Márquez had come to the mud through geology and landscape. Roy had come through the body’s encounter with the ground. They had arrived at the same sentence.</p>
<p>I wrote the sentence down: <em>The mud was cold and red and worked its way between her toes like fingers.</em></p>
<p>“Now,” Roy said, and she leaned forward in a way that signaled the conversation was about to change direction, “the children. You said they don’t age.”</p>
<p>I described the idea: children born from the ritual who freeze at different developmental stages. Sebastián at fourteen months. A daughter stuck perpetually at two. A son born old.</p>
<p>“The daughter at two,” Roy said. “She is stuck at <em>no</em>. Two is the age of refusal. She is frozen in the first moment of rebellion against the world. This is not a curse. This is a political condition.”</p>
<p>García Márquez frowned. “Not everything is political.”</p>
<p>“Everything about a woman’s body being used as a vessel for an ancestral ritual is political.”</p>
<p>“It is also a miracle.”</p>
<p>“Miracles are political.”</p>
<p>“Miracles are miracles. That is why we have a separate word for them.”</p>
<p>I watched this volley with the feeling of standing between two people playing tennis with a grenade. Both of them were right. That was the problem. If the children who don’t age are purely miraculous — gorgeous, strange, told in sweeping sentences — then the story becomes a fable. Beautiful but distant. If the children are purely political — embodiments of what happens when women’s bodies are instrumentalized by tradition — then the story becomes an argument. True but thin.</p>
<p>“The daughter will speak in tongues,” I said, not because I had planned to say it but because it appeared, fully formed, in the silence between them. “Not Pentecostal tongues. Archaic Spanish. The Spanish of viceregal decrees and land grants. And Quechua, or something near it. She speaks in the languages of the colonizer and the colonized simultaneously, and she uses them to describe things that haven’t happened yet.”</p>
<p>Roy put her thermos down. “That’s good.”</p>
<p>García Márquez tilted his head. “Why archaic Spanish?”</p>
<p>“Because the ritual goes back to the first Llorente who stepped off a ship in Cartagena. The daughter is carrying the whole weight of that lineage in her throat. She speaks in the register of the documents that created the family — the land grants, the certificates of baptism, the inventories of property including human property. The language of administration. But she uses it to prophesy, which is the opposite of administration. She takes the language of control and uses it to announce what cannot be controlled.”</p>
<p>“I want her to predict a flood,” García Márquez said. “And the flood comes. But not in the same sentence. The flood comes three paragraphs later, mentioned casually, the way you mention weather.”</p>
<p>“And a woman in a yellow dress,” Roy added. “She predicts a woman in a yellow dress who will knock on the door. And the woman arrives. But the yellow — the yellow should be wrong. Too bright. It should leave an afterimage. It should be a yellow that doesn’t belong in the Colombian highlands, a yellow that looks like it was imported from somewhere, like the Spanish themselves.”</p>
<p>This was the moment I understood what made them different and why the difference was generative. García Márquez wanted the prophecy to be verified by the world, casually, as one more fact among facts. Roy wanted the verification to carry within it a splinter of wrongness, a color that hurt, a sensory disturbance that proved the miracle was not free. The flood comes, yes. The woman in yellow arrives, yes. But the yellow persists. It stains the retina. It won’t leave the room. There is a cost, even in the confirmation.</p>
<p>“The house,” García Márquez said. He said it as though resuming a conversation that had been running underneath the one we were having. “The house must grow.”</p>
<p>“Of course.”</p>
<p>“Not metaphorically. Rooms must appear. Corridors must lead to places they did not lead to yesterday. This is not a haunting — I detest haunted houses — this is a house that is <em>reproducing</em>. The ritual was for children, but the house heard the ritual too. The house is fertile now. The house is pregnant with rooms.”</p>
<p>Roy was quiet for a long time. She turned her thermos cap in her hands. When she spoke, her voice was lower, more careful, as though she were handling something fragile. “A house that grows rooms for the years the children refuse to occupy. Is that what you mean? The children are frozen, so the house ages on their behalf, adding a room for each year they should have grown and didn’t.”</p>
<p>“Yes.”</p>
<p>“A nursery with a crib that rocks by itself.”</p>
<p>“Yes.”</p>
<p>“A library that no one stocked.”</p>
<p>“Yes.”</p>
<p>“And one room — there must be one room — that looks out onto the past. Not the future. The past. The courtyard as it was before the river changed course, before the house was built. If you sit in the chair in that room long enough, you can feel the heat of a fire that burned in 1847.”</p>
<p>García Márquez was nodding. He was nodding the way a conductor nods when the orchestra arrives at a passage they have been approaching for twenty minutes — not with surprise but with the satisfaction of inevitability.</p>
<p>“The garden,” I said. “The garden should bloom backward.”</p>
<p>They both looked at me.</p>
<p>“Bougainvillea. The color drains from the petals — the purple goes first, like water from a basin — and the petals retreat into the bracts, and the bracts into the stems. By evening it’s a skeleton of gray-green wood. By morning it blooms again. The cycle is daily. The garden is showing the house what time looks like when it runs in both directions.”</p>
<p>“The purple should leave traces on the walls,” Roy said. “If you touch the walls near the bougainvillea, your fingertips come away stained.”</p>
<p>“That is the cost again,” García Márquez said. He said it with something that might have been irritation or might have been admiration — with him, the two lived in the same room. “You want everything to leave a mark.”</p>
<p>“I want everything to be <em>physical</em>. You and I agree about magic. We agree that it does not need to be explained. Where we disagree — and I think this disagreement will be good for the story — is about whether magic has weight. In your books, the rain of yellow flowers falls and it is beautiful and it is mentioned once and the story moves on. A hundred years pass in a sentence. In my book — my one book — the moment that matters lasts for pages. It takes up space. You can smell it. The moth on Sophie Mol’s funeral, the way the sap from the rubber trees smells, the texture of the boat. I stay inside the physical instant because the instant is where the grief lives. You move through time because time is where the meaning accumulates.”</p>
<p>The café had emptied. The barista was wiping down the bar with the slow, circular motions of someone who wants you to leave but has been raised too well to say so. García Márquez seemed not to notice. Roy did notice and did not care.</p>
<p>“The ending,” I said. “I don’t know the ending.”</p>
<p>“Do not know the ending,” García Márquez said. “Know the last image. The last image is a room that did not exist before you wrote the sentence containing it.”</p>
<p>“The ending is not an ending,” Roy said. “The ending is the women getting up from the table and going to the rooms that need them. The ending is Tuesday. It was always Tuesday. It will always be Tuesday.”</p>
<p>“Why Tuesday?”</p>
<p>“Because doors can only be closed on Tuesdays,” García Márquez said, and when I asked why, he looked at me as though I had asked why rain was wet. “For reasons nobody remembers but everyone obeys.”</p>
<p>“I want the last paragraph to contain a child speaking in a tense that doesn’t exist,” Roy said. “Not past, not future, not even present. A tense for events that are happening and have happened and will happen at the same time. A tense that has no name in Spanish because Spanish was not designed for it. Spanish was designed for conquest. This tense is for something else.”</p>
<p>“What is it for?”</p>
<p>“I don’t know. That’s why I want the child to speak it and no one to be able to conjugate it. Not even the narrator. Especially not the narrator.”</p>
<p>García Márquez finished his tinto. He made a face. The tinto had been sitting too long. It had become what it was always going to become — lukewarm, bitter, faithful to its nature.</p>
<p>“There is a question we have not addressed,” he said. “Do the women break the spell?”</p>
<p>“No,” Roy said.</p>
<p>“No,” I agreed.</p>
<p>“But do they surrender to it?”</p>
<p>“Also no,” Roy said.</p>
<p>“Then what do they do?”</p>
<p>“They continue. That is the third option that no one ever writes because it is not dramatic enough. To break the spell is an ending. To surrender to the spell is an ending. To get up and go to the rooms that need you — that is not an ending. That is Tuesday.”</p>
<p>García Márquez looked at her for a long time. I could not read his expression. It had the quality of a man looking at a view he has seen many times but that still, despite everything, manages to be the view.</p>
<p>“The saints,” he said. “In the courtyard. They should cry throughout. Not at the beginning. Not at the end. Throughout. A continuous warm copper weeping that keeps the mud soft. Like a background condition. Like weather.”</p>
<p>“Like grief,” Roy said.</p>
<p>“I said weather.”</p>
<p>“You said weather. I heard grief.”</p>
<p>He shrugged — one of those expansive Colombian shrugs that contains within it an entire philosophy of acceptance and refusal simultaneously. “Maybe they are the same word. In the highlands, the weather is grief. The clouds come down and graze in the courtyard like cattle and the walls sweat and the roof tiles are the color of old blood. The house has been dying for two hundred years. What is that if not weather? What is that if not grief?”</p>
<p>Roy screwed the cap back on her thermos. The gesture had a finality to it that felt like the end of something, though nothing had been resolved. The children still did not age. The house still grew rooms. The saints still wept copper tears into the courtyard mud. The women still needed to decide what to do about all of it, and we had decided that they would decide not to decide, which is the hardest kind of story to write and which, I realized, was exactly the kind of story both of these writers had spent their entire careers making room for.</p>
<p>“One more thing,” Roy said, standing. “The grandmother’s notebook. It was not hidden behind the wall. It was found inside the wall. In the wall, like a letter in an envelope. This distinction matters.”</p>
<p>“Why?”</p>
<p>“Because behind the wall means someone was trying to keep it from being found. Inside the wall means someone was planting it. The wall is the garden. The notebook is the seed. The house has been growing this story inside itself for two hundred years, waiting for the right woman to scrape the mold away.”</p>
<p>García Márquez stood. He buttoned his jacket. “You should write that down,” he said to me.</p>
