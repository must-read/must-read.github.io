It was four in the afternoon on a Wednesday in January, and the light coming through the windows had that particular Los Angeles quality — warm and flat and faintly accusatory, as if the sun were asking why you were indoors. Joan Didion was already seated when I arrived, in a booth near the back, with a glass of white wine and a notebook open to a blank page. She was smaller than I expected, though I don’t know why I expected anything, and she was wearing sunglasses inside, which seemed less like an affectation than like a medical decision.</p>
<p>Hanif Abdurraqib arrived twelve minutes later, apologizing for the traffic on Sunset, carrying a tote bag from a bookstore I didn’t recognize and wearing a vintage Tribe Called Quest T-shirt under a corduroy jacket. He ordered a ginger ale. He sat down and immediately said, “I passed a billboard for a streaming service on the way here and it said ‘Everything you love, all in one place,’ and I almost turned around and went home.”</p>
<p>“That’s the essay,” Didion said, without looking up from her notebook. “That sentence. The lie of consolidation.”</p>
<p>“It’s not just a lie,” Abdurraqib said. “It’s a specific kind of lie. It’s the lie that says abundance is the same as access. That having everything available means everything matters equally. Which means nothing matters at all.”</p>
<p>I told them I wanted to write about the end of shared broadcast culture — the death of the signal, the splintering of what Americans could reasonably be expected to have all watched — and about what happened to Black performance when the signal fractured. Didion removed her sunglasses and set them on the table. Abdurraqib leaned forward.</p>
<p>“You’re writing an elegy,” Didion said.</p>
<p>“Maybe. I’m not sure yet.”</p>
<p>“No,” she said. “You are. I can hear it in the way you’re framing it. The death of something. The end of the broadcast. This is grief dressed up as cultural criticism, and you should know that before you start, because grief has a shape and if you don’t control it, it controls the prose.”</p>
<p>Abdurraqib shook his head. “I’m not sure it’s an elegy. Or — it doesn’t have to be only that. An elegy assumes the thing is dead. The broadcast might be dead. The thing the broadcast carried is not.”</p>
<p>“What do you mean?” I asked.</p>
<p>“I mean — okay. Soul Train goes off the air. That happened. Don Cornelius dies. That happened. But the dancers are still somewhere. Not metaphorically. Actually somewhere. People who were on that show in 1975 are alive right now, today, in Los Angeles and Chicago and Detroit, and their bodies still know the moves. The signal stopped. The dance didn’t.”</p>
<p>Didion picked up her wine glass but didn’t drink from it. She held it the way you hold something when you’re thinking. “That’s a nice sentiment,” she said, and the way she said ‘nice’ made it clear she did not entirely mean it as a compliment. “But the essay has to be honest about loss. The dance continues — fine. But the context in which the dance was received, the shared audience, the communal experience of watching the same thing at the same time — that is genuinely gone. And pretending otherwise is nostalgia, which is a liar.”</p>
<p>“Nostalgia is not always a liar,” Abdurraqib said.</p>
<p>“It is always a liar. It is selectively truthful, which is the same thing.”</p>
<p>“Joan.”</p>
<p>“I’m not being cruel. I’m being precise.”</p>
<p>“You’re being precise about something I’m not talking about,” Abdurraqib said, and there was an edge in his voice that I hadn’t expected, a sharpness that came from caring about the distinction. “I’m not saying we should be nostalgic for the broadcast. The broadcast was built on exclusion. Three networks, all run by white men, deciding what America got to see. The reason Soul Train mattered is that it was a crack in the wall — Don Cornelius figured out how to put Black joy on a screen that was designed to exclude it. I’m not nostalgic for the wall. I’m trying to say something about the crack.”</p>
<p>A silence. The bartender was polishing glasses. Outside, a car alarm went off and then stopped.</p>
<p>“That’s useful,” Didion said, finally. “The crack in the wall. The essay should be about the crack, not the wall.”</p>
<p>“But the wall has to be in the essay,” I said. “The reader has to understand what the broadcast was — the scale of it, the shared-ness of it — before they can understand what it means that it ended.”</p>
<p>“Of course,” Didion said. “You describe the wall. You describe the crack. You describe the light that came through. What you do not do is pretend the wall was beautiful. The wall was a structure. Some of us lived inside it comfortably. Others did not. That asymmetry is not incidental to the essay. It is the essay.”</p>
<p>Abdurraqib was quiet for a moment. He was turning his glass on the table, rotating it slowly, and I realized later that this was how he thought — his hands had to be doing something.</p>
<p>“Here’s where I think we disagree,” he said. “And I want to disagree carefully, because I respect the position. Joan, you’re saying the broadcast was a structure of exclusion that happened to transmit some extraordinary things. And I’m saying the extraordinary things are the subject, and the structure is the context. The essay should be about Whitney Houston singing in Houston in 1986. It should be about James Brown at the T.A.M.I. Show. It should be about the moment when a human body does something that exceeds the apparatus carrying it. The broadcast is the frame. The performance is the painting.”</p>
<p>“You can’t separate them,” Didion said.</p>
<p>“You can’t collapse them either.”</p>
<p>I said something then that I’m not sure was right, but it changed the direction of the conversation. I said: “What if the essay is about the gap? Not the broadcast and not the performance, but the space between them. The distance between what the signal carried and what the body did. The fact that Whitney Houston’s voice on a four-inch phone screen in 2025 is not the same as Whitney Houston’s voice in a room in 1986, and it’s not worse, and it’s not better — it’s a different kind of encounter, and the essay is about what happens in that difference.”</p>
<p>Abdurraqib pointed at me. “That. Stay there.”</p>
<p>Didion was less convinced. “The gap is interesting but it’s not enough. An essay needs a nervous system. It needs a person inside it who is at risk. Who are you in this essay? Why are you watching these videos? What are you afraid of?”</p>
<p>“I don’t know yet.”</p>
<p>“Then you aren’t ready to write it.”</p>
<p>“She’s right,” Abdurraqib said, which seemed to surprise even him. “I mean — the gap is the intellectual subject. But the emotional subject has to be personal. Why can’t you stop watching the Whitney Houston video? What is it doing to you? An essay about culture that doesn’t cost the writer anything is just a lecture.”</p>
<p>“I’ve read a number of lectures published as essays in the past ten years,” Didion said. “They are very popular. They are also very careful. Careful writing is the enemy of good nonfiction.”</p>
<p>“I’d push back on that,” Abdurraqib said. “Some of the best nonfiction I know is careful. What it isn’t is cautious. Careful means you’ve chosen every word. Cautious means you’ve avoided every risk.”</p>
<p>Didion actually smiled. It was brief and it was mostly in her eyes, but it was there. “That’s a real distinction,” she said. “Fine. Careful, not cautious.”</p>
<p>I ordered a coffee. The light in the bar had changed — the sun had moved behind the building and now the room was in that amber half-dark that Los Angeles hotel bars specialize in, neither bright nor dim, a perpetual twilight that makes everyone look slightly better and slightly sadder.</p>
<p>“Can we talk about California?” I said. “Because I think the essay has to be set here. Not just physically but psychically. Los Angeles as the place where the broadcast was invented and where it died.”</p>
<p>“Los Angeles is always the place where the thing is invented and where it dies,” Didion said. “That’s what Los Angeles is. The city has no memory. It only has real estate.”</p>
<p>“I grew up in Columbus, Ohio,” Abdurraqib said. “I watched Soul Train in my aunt’s living room. For me, Los Angeles was always the place where the broadcast came from — this distant, impossible city where Black people were on television being beautiful, and the signal traveled from there to Ohio and it meant something different when it arrived. The essay should account for that. The broadcast didn’t just exist. It traveled. It arrived in different rooms and meant different things.”</p>
<p>“The rooms,” I said. “That’s the unit. Not the signal — the room where the signal was received.”</p>
<p>“And the room where it dies,” Didion said. “Which is this room. Which is every room now. Because the signal has been replaced by the algorithm, and the algorithm does not enter a room. It enters a person. It is private. It is solitary. It is custom-fitted to your loneliness.”</p>
<p>Abdurraqib set his glass down harder than he intended. “But people still sing along. That’s what I keep coming back to. You’re in a bar, and Solange comes on, and strangers start singing, and for ninety seconds the algorithm fails and the broadcast returns. It’s small. It’s fleeting. But it happens.”</p>
<p>“Does it, though?” Didion said. “Or do we just want it to? I have spent a career being suspicious of moments that feel redemptive, because the desire for redemption is so strong that it manufactures evidence.”</p>
<p>That landed. I could see it land on Abdurraqib — not as a wound, exactly, but as a weight. He sat with it.</p>
<p>“I think,” he said slowly, “that the difference between us is that I’ve seen too many rooms where it was real. Where the singing was real. Where the dancing was real. Where Black people gathered and made something out of nothing and the joy was not manufactured and was not compensatory and was not a response to suffering but was its own thing, its own fact, as real as the suffering and as old. And I can’t write from a place that doesn’t trust that. I just can’t.”</p>
<p>“I’m not asking you to distrust it. I’m asking the essay to interrogate it.”</p>
<p>“Those might be the same thing.”</p>
<p>“They are not the same thing. Interrogation is not skepticism. Interrogation is taking something seriously enough to ask it hard questions. If the joy is real, it can survive the questions.”</p>
<p>Another silence. The bartender had turned on a small television behind the bar, and it was showing a basketball game with the sound off — players moving in slow, silent patterns, the ball arcing, the crowd’s mouths open in soundless exhortation. We all watched for a moment without commenting on it. It felt appropriate.</p>
<p>“Let me ask something,” I said. “The essay is going to move in fragments. That’s the structure. Like The White Album — pieces that accumulate into a mosaic rather than a linear argument. But The White Album is fundamentally a record of things falling apart. Of the center not holding. If this essay borrows that structure, does it inherit that thesis?”</p>
<p>Didion considered this. “The structure of The White Album is not the thesis of The White Album. The fragments in that book were a formal response to a specific historical moment — the late sixties, the Manson murders, the sense that the narrative had broken down. If your historical moment is different, the fragments should be doing something different.”</p>
<p>“Our moment isn’t that different,” I said.</p>
<p>“Every generation believes it is living through the end of the world. Most generations are wrong. Some generations are right. The difference is not in the feeling but in the evidence.”</p>
<p>“I think the fragments should be accumulating toward something,” Abdurraqib said. “Not falling apart. Or — falling apart and accumulating at the same time. Like a catalog. Like a list of performances you keep returning to. Each fragment is a return. Each return adds something. The structure isn’t collapse — it’s devotion. You keep pressing play.”</p>
<p>“That is a fundamentally different essay than the one Joan is describing,” I said.</p>
<p>“Yes,” they both said, nearly simultaneously, and then looked at each other with what I can only describe as professional respect sharpened by genuine disagreement.</p>
<p>“Maybe it’s both,” I said, and immediately regretted it, because “maybe it’s both” is the refuge of someone who doesn’t want to choose.</p>
<p>“It cannot be both,” Didion said. “You are either writing about loss or you are writing about persistence. The same essay cannot do both without becoming sentimental, which is the word I use for essays that want credit for their own sadness.”</p>
<p>“I disagree completely,” Abdurraqib said. “The best essay about loss I ever read is also the best essay about persistence I ever read and it is ‘Notes of a Native Son,’ and Baldwin holds both without flinching for thirty pages and never once becomes sentimental, because he is too angry to be sentimental and too loving to be merely angry.”</p>
<p>Didion said nothing. She picked up her pen and wrote something in her notebook. I could not see what it was. She closed the notebook.</p>
<p>“Baldwin is a special case,” she said, quietly.</p>
<p>“Everyone is a special case. That’s what makes writing hard.”</p>
<p>The basketball game on the silent television had gone to a commercial — a car advertisement, a phone advertisement, an advertisement for a streaming service. Everything you love, all in one place. Abdurraqib saw it and shook his head.</p>
<p>I asked about Don Cornelius. I said I wanted to write about his death — about the distance between “love, peace, and soul” and the silence of a man dying alone in his house in Los Angeles. About performance as a choice about which truth to broadcast.</p>
<p>“That’s the center of the essay,” Abdurraqib said, immediately. “If there’s a center. Cornelius is the figure who held the broadcast together — literally, physically, with his body and his voice and his suit — and when he ended his own broadcast, the silence that followed was not the silence of a television turning off. It was a different silence. The essay has to distinguish between those silences.”</p>
<p>“The silence of the medium ending and the silence of the man ending,” Didion said.</p>
<p>“Yes.”</p>
<p>“And you want the essay to say that the man’s silence is more real? More significant?”</p>
<p>“I want the essay to say that the man’s silence is the one that costs something. The medium’s silence is structural. The man’s silence is — ” He stopped. He looked at the table. “The man’s silence is the kind you hear in your body.”</p>
<p>Didion nodded. She did not say anything for what felt like a long time but was probably thirty seconds.</p>
<p>“Write about the body,” she said, finally. “Both of you keep circling it. The body on the stage. The body in the living room watching. The body that remembers the dance. The body that stops. If the essay has a subject, it is the body — what the body knows that the signal cannot carry, what the body retains after the broadcast ends. Write about the body and you will not have to choose between loss and persistence, because the body is where they are the same thing.”</p>
<p>Abdurraqib looked at her. “Did you just solve it?”</p>
<p>“I solved nothing. I gave you an image. You will have to solve it on the page.”</p>
<p>“She’s right that it’s not solved,” I said. “Because the question I still have is: whose body? Mine? Cornelius’s? Whitney Houston’s? The dancer on the Soul Train line? The woman singing Solange in a bar in Oakland? If the body is the subject, which body?”</p>
<p>“All of them,” Abdurraqib said.</p>
<p>“That’s too many,” Didion said.</p>
<p>“All of them experienced through one,” Abdurraqib said. “Yours. The essayist’s. The writer who watches the videos and tries to learn the dance and falls down and writes about it anyway. The body that contains all the other bodies is the body of the person watching.”</p>
<p>The bartender changed the channel. Now there was a music video — someone I didn’t recognize, in a room full of dancers, and the movement was liquid and precise and unself-conscious in the way that only filmed bodies can be, because the camera makes self-consciousness impossible by making the performance permanent.</p>
<p>“I have a question,” I said. “About nostalgia. Because I know, Joan, that you think nostalgia is a liar. And I know, Hanif, that you think it’s more complicated than that. So what do I do when I’m writing about Whitney Houston in 1986 and I feel the pull — the pull toward saying it was better then, the signal was purer, the performance meant more because it was shared? How do I write with that pull without surrendering to it?”</p>
<p>“You name it,” Didion said. “You say: I feel this pull, and I know it is a trap, and I am going to describe the trap from the inside.”</p>
<p>“You honor it,” Abdurraqib said. “You say: this pull is real, and it is telling me something true about what I have lost, and I am going to follow it far enough to learn what it knows and then I am going to keep going, past the nostalgia, into whatever is on the other side.”</p>
<p>“What’s on the other side?”</p>
<p>“I don’t know. That’s why you write the essay.”</p>
<p>I looked at Didion. “You disagree.”</p>
<p>“I always disagree. It’s how I know I’m paying attention.” She put her sunglasses back on. “Write it. Write the essay about the broadcast and the body and the silence and the song. Make it fragments. Make each fragment earn its place. Do not resolve it. Do not make it hopeful unless the hope is earned on every line, and even then, suspect it. Suspect every sentence that makes you feel good about yourself. The sentence that makes you uncomfortable is the one that is working.”</p>
<p>Abdurraqib stood up. He put on his jacket. “And play the Whitney Houston video again,” he said. “Play it until you can describe what her voice is doing. Not metaphorically. Not poetically. What it is actually doing — the breath, the control, the moment where she lets go. Because if you can describe that, you have the essay. And if you can’t, you have to keep watching until you can.”</p>
<p>He dropped a twenty on the table for his ginger ale and walked toward the door. At the threshold he turned back.</p>
<p>“Love, peace, and soul,” he said.</p>
<p>It sounded like a benediction. It sounded like a sign-off. It sounded, in the amber half-light of that hotel bar, like the last line of something I hadn’t written yet, and I sat there with Didion’s silence and Abdurraqib’s exit and the muted basketball game and the music video and my cold coffee, and I did not write anything in my notebook. I did not know what the essay was yet. I only knew what it felt like, which was the same thing the essay would be about: the sound of something that had already ended, still playing in the room.</p> </section> <div class="meeting-footer" data-astro-cid-uzeevf5o> <div class="meeting-footer__nav" data-astro-cid-uzeevf5o> <a href="/read/still-here-at-the-end-of-the-broadcast/" class="meeting-footer__link meeting-footer__link--primary" data-astro-cid-uzeevf5o>
