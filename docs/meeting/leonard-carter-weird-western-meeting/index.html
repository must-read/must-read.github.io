I thought it was a power outage until I noticed the fixtures were on — brass sconces throwing small circles of amber onto wallpaper that depicted a hunting scene, hounds and riders repeating every three feet, the pattern slightly off-register so the dogs’ legs didn’t quite line up with their bodies. Carter had chosen the place. It was in Tucson, technically, though it felt like it belonged somewhere that had been scraped off a European hillside and deposited in the Sonoran Desert by a confused god.</p>
<p>Leonard was already at the bar. He was drinking something clear and fizzy — club soda, I’d later learn — and reading a folded section of newspaper with the posture of a man who had sat at a thousand bars and knew how to make each one into an office. He was wearing a sport coat over a polo shirt, which on anyone else would have looked like a costume but on him looked like a decision he’d made thirty years ago and saw no reason to revisit.</p>
<p>I sat next to him and ordered coffee. He didn’t look up from the paper.</p>
<p>“She’ll be late,” he said.</p>
<p>“You’ve met her before?”</p>
<p>“No. But I know the type. People who pick hotels like this are people who need the room to say something before they walk into it. That takes time.”</p>
<p>He folded the paper and set it aside. “So we’re writing a Western that isn’t a Western.”</p>
<p>“A weird Western,” I said.</p>
<p>“I don’t like that word. Weird. It’s an excuse. You call something weird and you’re giving yourself permission to not make sense. A story has to make sense, even when the things in it don’t.”</p>
<p>I started to reply but the elevator opened and Angela Carter emerged. She was wearing a dark red dress and boots — actual boots, desert-appropriate, scuffed at the heels — and she carried a leather bag that looked like it had traveled more than I had. She surveyed the lobby the way a stage director surveys a set: evaluating what was already there, deciding what would need to change.</p>
<p>“This is perfect,” she said, sitting down between us and signaling the bartender without looking at him. “It looks like a saloon that had a nervous breakdown and woke up in a Victorian novel.”</p>
<p>“It looks like a bar,” Leonard said.</p>
<p>“Everything looks like a bar to you, Elmore. That’s your gift and your limitation.”</p>
<p>He almost smiled. Almost. “What are you having?”</p>
<p>“Mezcal. Neat. When in the desert.”</p>
<p>The bartender brought her drink and she cupped it in both hands, a gesture I associated more with tea than spirits. She inhaled before she drank.</p>
<p>“The smoke in this,” she said. “You know they roast the hearts of the agave in underground pits. Like burial. Like a body being prepared. Everything in the desert is a funeral that turns into a feast.”</p>
<p>“Or a drink,” Leonard said. “Sometimes it’s just a drink.”</p>
<p>They regarded each other with the wariness of two professionals who respect each other’s work and are completely baffled by how the other one does it. I had the feeling this was going to be a long afternoon.</p>
<p>“I want to talk about reluctance,” I said. “The reluctant gunfighter. Valdez, specifically — a man who doesn’t want to fight but gets pushed until fighting is the only language left.”</p>
<p>“Valdez was simple,” Leonard said, and the way he said simple made it clear he meant it as the highest compliment. “He was a man with a code. The code was: leave me alone and I’ll leave you alone. Then someone violated the code. Then he had to act. Everything that makes the story work is in the gap between how long he waits and what he does when he stops waiting.”</p>
<p>“That gap is the whole Western genre,” I said.</p>
<p>“It’s the whole American genre. The reluctant man. The patient man. We love that story because it lets us believe violence is always a last resort, that the man with the gun tried everything else first. Which is mostly a lie. But it’s a good lie. It makes for a good story.”</p>
<p>Carter set her glass down. “The reluctant man is also the most dangerous man, because his reluctance is what authorizes the violence. If he wanted to fight, he’d be a bully. Because he doesn’t want to fight, when he finally does, the audience reads it as justice. You’ve laundered the violence through his patience.”</p>
<p>“I haven’t laundered anything.”</p>
<p>“Not you personally, darling. The genre. The form. The reluctant gunfighter is a machine for making violence feel earned. And I’m interested in what happens when that machine breaks — when the reluctance isn’t a prologue to justified violence but a door into something the violence can’t solve.”</p>
<p>Leonard shifted on his stool. I could see him weighing whether to engage with this or redirect it. He chose engagement, which surprised me.</p>
<p>“You want the violence to fail.”</p>
<p>“I want the violence to succeed at the wrong thing. A man rides into a canyon to confront the men who wronged him. He has a rifle and a grievance and every right to use both. But the canyon isn’t a canyon anymore. Or it is, but it’s also something else. The walls change color when he isn’t looking. The shadows have weight. His horse won’t go further. Not won’t — can’t. The horse understands something the man doesn’t.”</p>
<p>“Horses always understand something the man doesn’t,” Leonard said. “That’s been true since the first Western. It’s a cheat.”</p>
<p>“It’s not a cheat if the horse is right. If the landscape has genuinely become something the horse recognizes and the man doesn’t, because horses live closer to the ground and the ground is where the change is happening.”</p>
<p>“What change?”</p>
<p>“The fairy-tale change. The threshold. In every fairy tale there is a forest. A boundary between the world of rules and the world where rules dissolve. In the Brothers Grimm it’s literal — the children enter the forest and the forest rearranges their reality. In the Western, the equivalent is the territory beyond town. The desert, the canyon, the badlands. The place where law stops and something older begins.”</p>
<p>Leonard looked at me. “She wants to turn the canyon into a fairy tale.”</p>
<p>“I want to acknowledge that the canyon was always a fairy tale. The Western landscape has never been realistic. It has always been a symbolic space where American men go to discover who they are by killing things. I’m proposing we stop pretending that’s realism and let the landscape be what it actually is — a psychic space. A space of transformation.”</p>
<p>“I don’t write psychic spaces. I write rooms. I write a man sitting across from another man, and one of them is going to do something and the other one is going to react, and the interest is in the gap between what they say and what they do.”</p>
<p>“Yes. And that gap is where I live. The gap between what is said and what is meant, between what is seen and what is — that’s the uncanny. That’s the Gothic. You and I occupy the same gap, Elmore. We just furnish it differently.”</p>
<p>He considered this. I watched him consider it. Leonard was not a man who processed ideas publicly — he kept his thinking offstage, the way he kept backstory offstage, and what you saw was the conclusion arriving without its luggage.</p>
<p>“Alright,” he said. “The canyon changes. Fine. But the man doesn’t change with it. The man stays the man. He notices the walls are wrong. He notices his horse has stopped. He says, ‘The hell is this.’ He doesn’t have a revelation. He doesn’t fall to his knees. He reacts the way a competent man reacts to something incomprehensible, which is to check his rifle and keep his mouth shut.”</p>
<p>“That’s beautiful,” Carter said, and she meant it. “The competent man facing the incomprehensible. That’s the story. Because his competence — his lean, American, toolbox competence — is exactly what won’t help him here. The rifle is useless. The mouth shut is useless. The things that make him a Leonard character are the things that make him helpless in a Carter landscape.”</p>
<p>“He’s not helpless. He adapts.”</p>
<p>“Adapting to the supernatural is called transformation. And transformation in fairy tales always costs something. A hand. An eye. A name.”</p>
<p>“I’m not cutting off anybody’s hand.”</p>
<p>“Not literally. But something has to be surrendered. The reluctant man enters the canyon carrying his identity — his name, his code, his competence — and the canyon demands a piece of it. Not all of it. I’m not interested in destroying him. I’m interested in the part he gives up and what grows in the space where that part used to be.”</p>
<p>I spoke up. “The multiple voices might help with this. If we have two or three narrators, each one sees the canyon differently. Leonard’s narrator sees rock, shadow, a bad position tactically. Carter’s narrator sees the threshold, the fairy-tale boundary, the place where bodies become other things. And maybe a third voice — someone local, someone who’s lived near the canyon and knows what it does.”</p>
<p>“The local is key,” Carter said immediately. “Every fairy tale has the woodcutter’s wife. The woman who lives at the edge of the forest and warns the traveler. She’s been dismissed by the narrative for centuries — she’s a walk-on, a piece of furniture. But she’s the one who actually knows. She’s been living with the strangeness her whole life while the hero arrives and treats it as an adventure.”</p>
<p>“I like her,” Leonard said, and the plainness of it — <em>I like her</em> — was more decisive than any argument. “She runs a gas station. Or a diner. One of those places on a highway that exists because the highway does. She’s been there thirty years. She’s seen people go into the canyon and she’s seen some of them come back. She doesn’t explain. She doesn’t warn. She says ‘You want coffee?’ and the coffee is the warning.”</p>
<p>“The coffee is the warning,” Carter repeated, tasting the phrase. “Yes. Because domesticity is the only honest language for the uncanny. You don’t say ‘the canyon will transform you.’ You say ‘sit down, have some coffee, what’s the hurry.’ The delay is the kindness. She’s buying him time in the world where coffee still makes sense.”</p>
<p>“That’s good,” I said. “But I don’t want her to be only kindness. I don’t want the woodcutter’s wife to be a saint.”</p>
<p>“She shouldn’t be,” Carter said. “She should be complicated. She’s stayed at the edge of the forest — the edge of the canyon — because the strangeness is also where she’s most herself. She’s not there because she’s trapped. She’s there because the canyon gives her something the town doesn’t. Power? Knowledge? The pleasure of seeing competent men lose their footing?”</p>
<p>Leonard frowned. “You’re making her a witch.”</p>
<p>“I’m making her a woman who has learned something men refuse to learn. Which, historically, is the same thing.”</p>
<p>He didn’t argue with that. I thought he wanted to, but he didn’t, and the not-arguing was more interesting than any argument would have been. It sat between them like a card neither was willing to pick up.</p>
<p>I asked about the voice problem — how to make the multiple narrators formally distinct. Leonard’s dialogue-driven, stripped-to-bone sentences against Carter’s baroque, sensual, clause-heavy periods. Could those coexist in the same story without the seams showing?</p>
<p>“The seams should show,” Carter said. “In fairy tales, the stitching is visible. You can see where the silk meets the burlap. That’s not a flaw. That’s the form announcing itself. Let the narrators clash stylistically. Let one voice be dry and quick and the other be lush and strange and let the reader feel the friction between them.”</p>
<p>“Readers don’t like friction,” Leonard said.</p>
<p>“Your readers don’t like friction. My readers live for it.”</p>
<p>“My readers like a story that moves.”</p>
<p>“My readers like a story that transforms.”</p>
<p>“Same thing.”</p>
<p>“Not even close.” She finished her mezcal and I watched the bartender already reaching for the bottle, as if Carter’s thirst operated on a frequency he could detect. “Movement is horizontal. A man goes from here to there. Transformation is vertical. A man goes from what he is to what he becomes. You can do both. The Western does horizontal beautifully — the ride, the chase, the journey. But this story needs a vertical axis. The man enters the canyon moving forward and comes out moving upward. Or downward. Downward is more interesting.”</p>
<p>“Downward how?”</p>
<p>“Downward into himself. Into the animal part. Into the part that the frontier code was built to suppress. The code says: be competent, be restrained, wait your turn, then act with precision. The canyon says: you are meat and bone and appetite, and the thing you came here to kill is wearing your own face.”</p>
<p>“That’s horror,” I said.</p>
<p>“Of course it’s horror. All transformation is horror. Ask any adolescent. Ask any woman whose body has been legislated by men who’ve never inhabited one. The body changing without your consent — that is the primal horror. And it is also, sometimes, liberation. The wolf at the end of the fairy tale is not only a monster. The wolf is also the girl, finally, with teeth.”</p>
<p>Leonard ordered another club soda. The bartender brought it without comment. Outside, the Tucson sun was doing something violent to the parking lot — I could see the heat shimmer through the window, the asphalt buckling visually, the air itself becoming unreliable. It occurred to me that the desert was already doing what Carter wanted the canyon to do: making the visible world suspect.</p>
<p>“I keep coming back to the economics,” Leonard said. “In Valdez, the violence happens because of money. A rancher won’t pay what he owes a dead man’s wife. That’s it. The whole story pivots on a debt. I want that in this piece. The supernatural can do whatever it wants, but underneath it there should be a transaction. Someone owes something. Someone won’t pay. The refusal to pay is the crack the strangeness enters through.”</p>
<p>“I agree with that completely,” Carter said, and the completeness of her agreement seemed to startle them both. “The fairy tale is always about economics. Rumpelstiltskin is about labor theft. Beauty and the Beast is about a father’s financial debt paid with his daughter’s body. Bluebeard is about the price of a woman’s curiosity in a house she didn’t build. The fairy tale is the original literature of capitalism — it’s about what powerful people take from powerless people and what the powerless can take back.”</p>
<p>“And the Western is the same,” I said.</p>
<p>“The Western is the sequel,” Leonard said. “The fairy tale says you owe. The Western says pay up.”</p>
<p>Carter laughed. It was the first time she’d laughed and the sound was startling — low, rough, genuine, not the practiced amusement of a dinner party but the involuntary bark of someone who’d been surprised by a truth arriving in someone else’s voice.</p>
<p>“Pay up. Yes. That’s the story. Someone in the desert owes a debt — a real debt, dollars and cents, Elmore’s kind of debt — and the canyon is where the payment comes due. But the canyon doesn’t accept money. The canyon accepts something else. Something the debtor didn’t know he was carrying.”</p>
<p>“What is he carrying?”</p>
<p>“A version of himself that he’s never met. A version the code was designed to keep buried. The Western hero’s greatest achievement is self-suppression — he has made himself into a tool, a function, a man who does one thing well. The canyon dismantles that. The canyon says: you are not a function. You are a body, and the body has appetites, and the appetites have teeth.”</p>
<p>“You keep going back to teeth,” Leonard said.</p>
<p>“Because teeth are honest. Teeth are the one part of the body that doesn’t lie about what it wants.”</p>
<p>He looked at her. “You really believe that.”</p>
<p>“I’ve built a career on it.”</p>
<p>“Yeah.” He turned his glass in his hands. “I’ve built a career on dialogue. On what people say when they’re trying not to say what they mean. Your teeth thing — it’s the opposite of that. It’s what the body says when the mouth stops working.”</p>
<p>“Exactly. And in this story, the mouth stops working. The lean, competent, dialogue-driven man enters a space where dialogue fails. Where the body has to speak. That’s the weird in your weird Western — not monsters, not ghosts. The failure of the human mouth to narrate what is happening to the human body.”</p>
<p>I felt something lock into place when she said that. Not a plot — nothing so definite — but a shape. A man walking into a landscape that strips his competence from him layer by layer, narrated by voices that can’t agree on what’s happening because the event itself resists narration. One voice tries Leonard’s method: clean, declarative, what-happened-next. Another voice tries Carter’s: lush, metamorphic, what-it-felt-like-underneath. And the third voice — the woman at the edge, the one who’s lived with it — says almost nothing, and her near-silence is the most honest account of all.</p>
<p>“The third voice worries me,” I said. “I don’t want her to be the resolution. I don’t want her to explain the canyon.”</p>
<p>“She doesn’t explain,” Carter said. “She witnesses. She is the one who watches the man go in and watches something come out and she does not call it by his name. She calls it something else. Something in a language the story doesn’t translate.”</p>
<p>“I wouldn’t translate it either,” Leonard said.</p>
<p>“No?”</p>
<p>“No. Some things you leave alone. You put them on the page and you don’t unpack them. The reader either gets it or doesn’t. That’s the deal.”</p>
<p>Carter raised her glass — the second mezcal, half-gone already. “That’s the one thing we agree on. The unexplained image. The moment the story looks at something it cannot understand and does not blink and does not explain and simply says: this is here. What are you going to do about it?”</p>
<p>“That’s the ending,” Leonard said.</p>
<p>“That’s one ending. But this story has multiple voices. Which means it has multiple endings. Or the same ending seen from three directions. Like a canyon viewed from three rims.”</p>
<p>“Only two of those rims will have a view. The third will be looking at the sky.”</p>
<p>“Which one is looking at the sky?”</p>
<p>He didn’t answer. The lobby had darkened further — the sun had moved behind the building, or possibly behind a cloud, though there hadn’t been clouds when I arrived. The hunting-scene wallpaper seemed to shift in the changed light, the dogs’ dislocated legs appearing to move, the riders’ faces gaining expressions they hadn’t had before. Carter noticed it too. She looked at the wall with the satisfaction of someone who has been proven right by the furniture.</p>
<p>Leonard stood up and dropped a bill on the bar. “I’ve got to go.”</p>
<p>“Where?”</p>
<p>“Nowhere in particular. But I’ve said what I’ve got to say and if I stay longer I’ll start repeating myself, and that’s the one thing a writer can’t afford.”</p>
<p>He nodded at Carter — not warm, not cold, the nod of a man who has just spent two hours with someone who challenged every instinct he has and who he will be thinking about on the drive home whether he wants to or not.</p>
<p>“Elmore,” Carter said.</p>
<p>He stopped.</p>
<p>“The coffee. At the diner. At the edge. Make it terrible coffee. The worst coffee he’s ever had. Because kindness doesn’t have to be good. It just has to be offered.”</p>
<p>He stood there for a moment, processing that in his offstage way, and then he left through the lobby without looking at the wallpaper, which I think was deliberate — a refusal to let the room have the last word.</p>
<p>Carter and I sat in the dimming bar. She ordered a third mezcal, which the bartender poured with the reverence of a man who has recognized something in a customer that he cannot name.</p>
<p>“He’s right about the economics,” she said. “The debt is the spine. Without it, the supernatural is decoration. With it, the supernatural becomes consequence — the price the world exacts when the human price goes unpaid. That’s not magic. That’s justice operating in a register the courthouse can’t hear.”</p>
<p>“And the multiple voices?”</p>
<p>“The voices are the wound. Every wound looks different depending on where you’re standing. One narrator sees the entry. One sees the exit. One sees the blood. None of them see the bullet. The bullet is the thing the story can’t narrate, because the bullet is the transformation itself, and transformation, by definition, destroys the language that existed before it.”</p>
<p>She drank. Outside, the heat shimmer had intensified. The parking lot looked liquid — the cars appeared to float on a surface that wasn’t asphalt anymore, that was something older and less solid, something that might, if you watched long enough, begin to move.</p>
<p>“I have one more question,” I said. “The man who enters the canyon — does he come out?”</p>
<p>Carter looked at the window, at the liquid parking lot, at the desert light doing its slow violence to the idea of solid ground.</p>
<p>“Something comes out,” she said.</p> </section> <div class="meeting-footer" data-astro-cid-uzeevf5o> <div class="meeting-footer__nav" data-astro-cid-uzeevf5o> <a href="/read/leonard-carter-weird-western/" class="meeting-footer__link meeting-footer__link--primary" data-astro-cid-uzeevf5o>
