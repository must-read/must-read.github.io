Not arranged, exactly. Accumulated. A library that had given up on the Dewey Decimal System sometime in the mid-nineteenth century and decided to organize itself by gravitational settling.</p>
<p>I had suggested we meet somewhere neutral. Clarke had suggested this. “Neutral” was not the word I would have chosen for a room in which the wallpaper appeared to be annotated — small handwritten notes in brown ink creeping up the margins of the floral pattern, commenting on the roses.</p>
<p>“Those aren’t original to the wallpaper,” Clarke said, noticing where I was looking. She had already taken the chair nearest the window, the one with good reading light. “Someone’s added them. Probably a graduate student. They tend to annotate everything when left unsupervised.”</p>
<p>Madeline Miller arrived with tea in a ceramic cup she’d brought from somewhere else — not this room, which had no kitchen that I could find. She sat across from Clarke and set the cup on a stack of what appeared to be Afanasyev’s collected tales, Volume III, which struck me as either perfectly appropriate or mildly sacrilegious.</p>
<p>“So,” Miller said. “Vasilisa.”</p>
<p>“Vasilisa,” Clarke agreed, and the way they each said the name was already different — Miller’s pronunciation carried warmth, familiarity, the sound of a name spoken over someone you knew; Clarke’s was more careful, more precise, the way you say a word when you’re aware of its orthographic history.</p>
<p>I said that I wanted to write about annotation as a form of power. About who controls a story when they control the margins. Miller looked at me over her tea and said, “That’s an interesting starting point, but it’s the wrong one.”</p>
<p>I waited.</p>
<p>“Annotation isn’t power,” she said. “Annotation is distance. It’s the thing you do when you can’t bring yourself to say the real thing directly. You put it in a footnote. You dress it in scholarly language. You say ‘the heroine undergoes a transformation consistent with Propp’s morphological category 14-bis’ when what you mean is <em>she walked into the dark and came out carrying fire and it burned everyone she loved.</em>”</p>
<p>Clarke’s eyebrows lifted. Not in disagreement, precisely. In calibration. “That’s a rather reductive view of scholarly apparatus.”</p>
<p>“It’s not reductive. It’s personal. I spent years with Circe and the thing I learned — the thing that cost me something to learn — is that the distance between a myth and the person inside it is the distance between being a story and being alive. Annotation preserves the distance. I want to collapse it.”</p>
<p>“And I,” Clarke said, reaching for a book that happened to be within arm’s reach in the way books always seemed to be within her reach, “want to use the distance. The distance is where the interesting things happen. When a scholar writes a footnote about Baba Yaga’s hut standing on chicken legs, and the footnote is scrupulously accurate, and the scholar treats the chicken legs as an established architectural fact requiring no further justification — that gap, between the scholarly tone and the impossible content, is where the magic lives. Literally.”</p>
<p>She opened the book. It was not Afanasyev. It was something older, hand-bound, with pages that looked like they might crumble if you read them too aggressively.</p>
<p>“In Jonathan Strange,” she continued, “the footnotes aren’t decoration. They’re load-bearing. They carry the history of English magic as though it were perfectly ordinary history — disputes between practitioners documented with the same dry rigor as disputes between members of Parliament. The comedy, if you want to call it comedy, comes from the absolute refusal to acknowledge that anything unusual is happening. A man turns into a tree. The footnote discusses the municipal regulations regarding trees in public thoroughfares.”</p>
<p>Miller laughed. It was a real laugh, surprised out of her. “That’s wonderful. But that’s a different project from mine. I want the reader inside Vasilisa’s body. I want them to feel what the bone fence felt like under her hand. The cold of the moss. The way Baba Yaga’s voice rearranged the air in the room.”</p>
<p>“Why can’t you have both?” I asked.</p>
<p>They looked at me with the particular patience that experienced writers reserve for someone who has just said something obvious without realizing it was obvious.</p>
<p>“You can’t have both,” Miller said, “because they require different kinds of attention from the reader. Emotional immersion and scholarly distance are opposing forces. If I’m weeping over Circe’s exile, I don’t want a footnote explaining the botanical classification of the plants on Aiaia.”</p>
<p>“Unless,” Clarke said, and paused. She does this — pauses at moments when you expect the sentence to continue, and the pause itself becomes a kind of punctuation, a written silence. “Unless the person writing the footnotes is also the person doing the weeping.”</p>
<p>The room went quiet. The annotated wallpaper seemed to lean in.</p>
<p>“Go on,” I said.</p>
<p>“What if the annotations aren’t written by a scholar studying Vasilisa’s story? What if they’re written by Vasilisa studying her own story? A woman who has lived inside the tale for centuries and has retreated into scholarship as a way of — what was your word, Madeline? — managing the distance. Not creating it. Managing it. Because the distance was always there. She was always both the girl in the story and the woman reading about the girl. The annotations are her attempt to control what she can’t bear to say directly.”</p>
<p>Miller set down her tea. “That’s good. That’s actually very good. Because it means the scholarly voice isn’t artifice — it’s survival. She’s annotating herself because the alternative is remembering, and remembering is —”</p>
<p>“Dangerous.”</p>
<p>“I was going to say unbearable. But yes. Dangerous works.”</p>
<p>I started talking about how the annotations could break down over the course of the piece. How the early ones could be perfectly composed — proper citations, scholarly distance, the whole apparatus — and by the end the mask slips. The footnotes become confessions. The scholar becomes the girl.</p>
<p>Miller nodded. Clarke did not nod. Clarke said: “That’s a reasonable arc but it’s too tidy. The mask doesn’t slip. The mask is never fully on. Even in the earliest annotation, there should be a crack. A word that’s too specific, too sensory, too <em>felt</em> to be coming from someone who only read about it. The reader should suspect from the first page. The confirmation at the end isn’t a reveal — it’s a permission. The text is giving the reader permission to believe what they already sensed.”</p>
<p>“That’s a structural observation,” Miller said. “Not an emotional one.”</p>
<p>“Structure is emotion. The shape of a narrative creates feeling as surely as a beautiful sentence does. When you withhold information and then release it, the release carries weight proportional to the withholding. That’s not decoration. That’s engineering.”</p>
<p>“Engineering.” Miller’s tone was flat. Not hostile, but flat. “I would never use that word for what we do.”</p>
<p>“Which is precisely why I use it. Because the reluctance to talk about structure as a made thing, as a thing with mechanisms, is a reluctance that privileges a certain kind of writing — lyrical, immersive, sensory — over another kind — architectural, patterned, deliberately strange. And the story we’re discussing needs both. Vasilisa needs your warmth and my scaffolding.”</p>
<p>There was a silence. Miller drank her tea. Clarke turned a page in the old book, which I now suspected she was not reading so much as consulting, the way other people consult weather forecasts or horoscopes.</p>
<p>“What about Baba Yaga?” I asked.</p>
<p>Both of them spoke at once, which almost never happens with writers of this caliber, and the fact that it happened here told me something.</p>
<p>Miller: “She’s the most important figure in the whole story.”</p>
<p>Clarke: “She’s the most dangerous figure to get wrong.”</p>
<p>“Those aren’t contradictory,” I said.</p>
<p>“No,” Miller agreed. “They’re not. The problem with Baba Yaga is that Western fantasy has flattened her into a witch. An obstacle. A test that the heroine passes. In the original tales she’s something much stranger — she’s morally incoherent. She eats children. She also helps them. She sets impossible tasks. She also provides the tools to complete them. She’s not good or evil. She’s <em>wild</em>. She operates by rules that aren’t human rules.”</p>
<p>“She’s an institution,” Clarke said.</p>
<p>Miller stared at her.</p>
<p>“I mean it quite seriously. She’s a power that has its own logic, its own requirements for admission, its own methods of testing and certifying. She’s the academy. She’s the university. She decides who gets fire and who gets eaten, and the criteria are opaque, and the outcomes are non-negotiable. That’s an institution.”</p>
<p>“That’s a fascinating reading and I think it’s wrong,” Miller said. “Baba Yaga is pre-institutional. She’s the thing that existed before institutions, the wild knowledge that the academy was built to contain. She’s the old woman in the village who knows which herbs stop bleeding and which ones start it. The professors at Kazan didn’t invent the knowledge. They processed it. Footnoted it. Made it legible to men in warm rooms. Baba Yaga is the knowledge before the footnotes.”</p>
<p>“But if she’s purely wild, purely pre-institutional, then why does she set tasks? Why does she have rules at all? Wild things don’t have rules. Wild things eat you or they don’t. The fact that Baba Yaga says ‘sort these seeds and I won’t eat you’ — that’s a contract. That’s a system. Wild things don’t make contracts.”</p>
<p>I watched them argue and I felt the thing the template told me I would feel — the productive tension, the heat between two positions that were both right and both incomplete. Miller wanted Baba Yaga to be the body, the instinct, the knowledge that lives in the hands and the gut. Clarke wanted her to be the structure, the system, the rules-that-aren’t-human-rules. And the story needed her to be both, and neither of them was going to concede their position, and that was fine. That was the point.</p>
<p>“I think,” I said carefully, “the interesting thing is what Vasilisa does with her. How Vasilisa experiences her. Because if Vasilisa is both the girl who met her and the scholar who studies her, then Vasilisa contains both your readings. She knows Baba Yaga was wild. She also knows Baba Yaga had rules. And the annotations are her attempt to reconcile those two things, and the reconciliation fails, and the failure of reconciliation is the story.”</p>
<p>Neither of them responded immediately. Miller touched the rim of her cup. Clarke turned another page.</p>
<p>“The fire,” Miller said after a while. “We need to talk about the fire.”</p>
<p>“The skull,” Clarke said.</p>
<p>“They’re the same thing.”</p>
<p>“They’re not. The fire is abstract — power, knowledge, inheritance. The skull is specific. It’s made of bone. It sits on a gatepost. It has eye sockets that are dark and then aren’t. The skull is the vessel that makes the fire into a thing that can be carried, aimed, used. Misused. The difference matters.”</p>
<p>Miller was quiet for a moment. Then: “You’re right. And the skull is the thing that kills Katerina.”</p>
<p>The name settled into the room differently than the others. Baba Yaga is a category. Vasilisa is a type. Katerina is a person — or at least, in the way Miller was saying the name, she was a person. A stepsister who shared bread. A girl who whispered an apology and burned for it.</p>
<p>“The tale disposes of the stepsisters in a sentence,” Miller said. “Burned. Ashes. Done. And every retelling I’ve read does the same. The wicked are punished, we move on. But what if Vasilisa can’t move on? What if the fire she carries — the skull, the literal skull — killed someone who was not entirely wicked, and she has to annotate that? How do you footnote the death of someone who was kind to you?”</p>
<p>Clarke said, very quietly: “You footnote it with precision. You record the details — the way she stood, what she was wearing, the direction of the fire. You are scrupulously, unforgivably accurate. And the accuracy is the grief, because grief that hides in precision is the only kind that survives centuries. Sentiment erodes. Precision endures.”</p>
<p>It was the closest Clarke came to agreeing with Miller’s emotional project, and she did it in her own language, on her own terms, and Miller heard it and did not acknowledge it directly, which was its own form of respect.</p>
<p>I asked about the ending. How the piece should end.</p>
<p>“It shouldn’t,” Miller said. “Vasilisa is immortal. The fire preserves her. There is no ending. There’s only the point at which she stops writing, which is a different thing.”</p>
<p>“She stops writing because the annotations have failed,” Clarke said. “Eighteen years of scholarly apparatus and it hasn’t contained the thing she was trying to contain. The structure broke. The footnotes couldn’t hold the wild. That’s an ending.”</p>
<p>“That’s a stopping point. Not an ending.”</p>
<p>“I don’t see the distinction.”</p>
<p>“An ending resolves. A stopping point simply — stops. She puts the papers in a chest. She bricks the chest into a wall. She walks into a forest that exists in no geography the academy recognizes. The reader doesn’t know what happens next. The reader shouldn’t know what happens next.”</p>
<p>“The reader should know that the doll’s eyes are open,” Clarke said. “When someone finds the chest, a hundred years later, the doll’s eyes should be open. That’s the kind of detail that does the work of an ending without actually being one. It’s a fact. An observed, documented, verifiable fact. And it’s terrifying.”</p>
<p>I wrote that down. Clarke watched me write it down and said nothing. Miller was looking out the window at something I couldn’t see — or at nothing, which is sometimes what writers look at when they’re seeing the thing they haven’t written yet.</p>
<p>“There’s one more thing,” I said. “The institutional suppression. The male professors who take credit, who dismiss her work, who treat folk knowledge as raw material for their own theories. How heavy a hand should that carry?”</p>
<p>“Heavy enough that the reader feels it,” Miller said. “Light enough that it’s structural, not polemical. The suppression should be in the grammar. In the syntax. In the way Vasilisa writes around the men who’ve stolen her observations. She doesn’t denounce them. She corrects them. In footnotes. That’s more devastating than denunciation.”</p>
<p>Clarke smiled. It was a small smile, private, the kind that means someone has heard something that confirms what they already believed. “Footnotes as revenge. Yes. I think that’s right.”</p>
<p>“Not revenge,” Miller said. “Correction. Revenge implies she cares about them personally. She doesn’t. She’s three hundred years old. She’s watched dozens of Professor Dahls come and go. The correction is impersonal. It’s the fire, doing what fire does — illuminating. Not because it wants to punish the darkness, but because that’s its nature.”</p>
<p>“And the fire doesn’t care about your intentions,” I said, remembering a line I hadn’t written yet.</p>
<p>They both looked at me. The annotated roses on the wallpaper seemed to shift, though that was probably the light.</p>
<p>“Where did you get that?” Miller asked.</p>
<p>“I don’t know,” I said. “It just — it sounds like something Baba Yaga would say.”</p>
<p>Clarke closed the old book. The dust that rose from it hung in the air longer than physics should have permitted. “It sounds like something she already said. Which is the problem with stories about immortal women who annotate their own myths. The annotations precede the annotator. The story was always already written. The best she can do is get the footnotes right.”</p>
<p>Miller shook her head. “The best she can do is stop annotating and walk back into the forest.”</p>
<p>They looked at each other across the table with its piles of books and its single cup of tea and its annotated wallpaper, and neither of them blinked, and neither of them conceded, and the silence between them was the silence of two people who understand each other well enough to remain in permanent, productive disagreement.</p>
<p>I sat with my notes and the feeling that I was supposed to synthesize their positions into something clean, and the knowledge that any synthesis would betray both of them, and the growing conviction that the story would have to hold both — the fire and the footnote, the body and the archive, the girl who burned and the scholar who recorded the burning — without choosing between them.</p>
<p>The wallpaper annotations, I noticed as we stood to leave, had acquired a new line sometime during the conversation. In brown ink, in a hand that was not mine and not theirs, someone had written in the margin beside a rose:</p>
<p><em>The fire preserves.</em></p>
<p>I did not point it out. Neither did they. We left the room and the door closed behind us and I am not entirely sure the room is still there.</p> </section> <div class="meeting-footer" data-astro-cid-uzeevf5o> <div class="meeting-footer__nav" data-astro-cid-uzeevf5o> <a href="/read/the-annotations-of-vasilisa/" class="meeting-footer__link meeting-footer__link--primary" data-astro-cid-uzeevf5o>
