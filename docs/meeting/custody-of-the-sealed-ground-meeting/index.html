James</p> <time datetime="2026-02-21" data-astro-cid-uzeevf5o>February 21, 2026</time> <hr class="header-divider" data-astro-cid-uzeevf5o> </header> <section class="reading-content" data-astro-cid-uzeevf5o> <p>The church basement smelled of damp concrete and burnt coffee. Someone had left a Mr. Coffee machine running on a folding table near the door, and whatever was in the carafe had reduced itself to a tarry residue that I was trying not to look at. The fluorescent tube above us had a flicker — not rhythmic, not predictable, just frequent enough that you couldn’t forget about it. King had claimed one of the metal folding chairs and tipped it back against the cinderblock wall, a paper cup of something from the gas station down the road balanced on his knee. James sat across from him at the long table they use for potluck suppers, his hands folded in front of him, looking at the burnt coffee with an expression that suggested he’d identified it as a symptom of civilizational decline.</p>
<p>I’d suggested a church basement because it seemed appropriate — we were going to talk about sealed ground, about burial, about things the earth holds in trust. I was already regretting it. The room had the specific sadness of all church basements: a place where people gather because they have nowhere better, furnished with furniture no one chose.</p>
<p>“The thing about a small town,” King said, without preamble, “is that everybody knows one thing. Not the same thing. Each person carries one piece of the picture, and they all walk around pretending their piece is the whole thing, or that the picture doesn’t exist. That’s what makes it work. That’s what makes it horrifying.”</p>
<p>“That is a distinctly American formulation,” James said. “The horror of collective denial.”</p>
<p>“You got a better one?”</p>
<p>“I might suggest that the horror is not in the denial but in the knowledge itself. The keeper of the sealed ground — and I mean that quite specifically, the person whose family has been tasked with maintaining some boundary — that person’s terror is not that others don’t know. It’s that he does.”</p>
<p>I’d been thinking about custodianship. The word had been in my notes for a week, underlined twice, circled once, and I still wasn’t sure what I meant by it. “Can I ask about the custodian figure?” I said. “Because it seems like you’re both interested in it but from completely different angles.”</p>
<p>King set his cup on the table. “The custodian in my world is a guy. Working class. Maybe he runs the cemetery, maybe he’s the last selectman in a town that can barely keep the lights on. He knows something is buried out on the bluffs and he knows it has to stay buried, and every goddamn day he gets up and eats his cereal and drives his truck out there and checks that nothing’s been disturbed. And every day nothing has been disturbed. And that’s the horror — the nothing. Forty years of nothing. Because after forty years of nothing, you start to wonder if maybe the thing was never real, and that’s when you get careless.”</p>
<p>“The custodian in my work,” James said, “would never eat cereal.”</p>
<p>King laughed. It was a big laugh, too big for the basement. “Okay, Monty. What does your custodian eat?”</p>
<p>“He doesn’t eat in the story. That’s rather the point. My custodian is a figure of scholarly restraint — a man of the church, perhaps, or a family line tasked with maintaining a boundary they understand in covenantal rather than practical terms. He would not describe his burden in the language of the everyday. He would describe it, if he described it at all, in the language of obligation and silence.”</p>
<p>“But he’s still a person,” I said. “Even your custodians are people. Paxton in ‘A Warning to the Curious’ — he’s not a mythic figure. He’s a man with a bicycle and a bad feeling.”</p>
<p>James considered this. The fluorescent tube flickered. “Paxton is not the custodian. Paxton is the fool who digs up what the custodian has spent generations protecting. The custodian — the last of the Ager family, the figure on the path — is barely a person at all by the time we encounter him. He has been reduced to his function. He is the boundary itself.”</p>
<p>“That’s the part that gets me,” King said, leaning forward. “The boundary as a person. Because in my experience — and I’m talking about real small towns, real Maine, real places where people have been doing the same thing for two hundred years because their grandfather did it — the person who keeps the secret doesn’t become the secret. He becomes a drunk. He becomes the guy at the end of the bar at Rosie’s who talks too much on his third Bud Light and nobody listens because he’s been talking too much for thirty years. The custodian erodes. He doesn’t calcify into a symbol. He falls apart.”</p>
<p>There was a silence after that. I could hear the Mr. Coffee machine making a sound that no coffee machine should make — a thin, aspirated wheeze, like the last breath of something small.</p>
<p>“You’re both describing what happens to the guardian,” I said. “But what happens to the ground?”</p>
<p>James looked at me sharply. “The ground?”</p>
<p>“The sealed place. The thing that’s been kept shut. What does it do while it’s waiting?”</p>
<p>“It doesn’t wait,” James said. “It doesn’t do anything. That’s a modern error — the assumption that evil must be active, must have agency, must want something. The sealed ground in my conception is not a prison containing a creature that paces and plots. It is a condition. A wrongness in the earth that was recognized and contained. The lead casket and the covenant and the family line — these are not a lock on a cage. They are a ritual acknowledgment that this place is not right, and that human beings have agreed, across generations, to behave as though it matters.”</p>
<p>“But something does come out,” King said. “Eventually. Something always comes out. Because the story doesn’t work if the seal holds. The seal has to fail.”</p>
<p>“Does it?”</p>
<p>King stared at him. “You’re telling me the seal holds in your stories?”</p>
<p>“I’m telling you that in ‘A Warning to the Curious,’ the story’s horror is not what emerges from the ground. Nothing emerges from the ground. The horror is what happens to the man who disturbed it. The consequences are personal, not geological. No evil force sweeps through the countryside. One man dies because he could not leave well enough alone.”</p>
<p>“One man dies,” King repeated. “And that’s enough.”</p>
<p>“It has always been enough for me.”</p>
<p>I was scribbling something in my notebook — a thought about the difference between a story where evil spreads and a story where evil waits, and whether those were actually different things or just different framings of the same thing. King saw me writing and grinned.</p>
<p>“You’re trying to split the difference,” he said. “I can see it from here. You’re thinking: what if the seal breaks and something gets out, but it gets out slowly? What if it spreads like my thing but feels like his thing — restrained, implied, a town going dark one house at a time and nobody can say exactly why?”</p>
<p>I put the pen down. “That’s exactly what I was thinking.”</p>
<p>“It won’t work,” James said.</p>
<p>“It might work,” King said.</p>
<p>“The slow spread — the town dying cell by cell — that is your métier, not mine. It requires the accumulation of domestic detail, the brand-name specificity, the Dunkin’ Donuts and the Dollar General. My horror does not accumulate. It discloses. A single document, a single inscription, a single figure glimpsed on a path. The reader is not worn down by proliferating evidence. The reader encounters one terrible thing and cannot look away.”</p>
<p>“But what if the single disclosure is that the town is already gone?” I said. I hadn’t planned to say it. It came out of the space between their two positions, and for a moment I wasn’t sure it was mine. “What if the protagonist arrives and everything looks normal — the lights are on, the gas station is open — but the story is really about realizing, piece by piece, that it’s too late? That whatever was sealed got out weeks ago and did its work in silence?”</p>
<p>King was quiet. He picked up his cup, looked into it, set it down.</p>
<p>“That’s the Jamesian move applied to the King canvas,” he said slowly. “The town is the document. Reading the town is reading the inscription.”</p>
<p>“I don’t despise the idea,” James said, which I was beginning to understand was his version of enthusiasm.</p>
<p>“The question is who reads it,” I said. “Who’s the protagonist? Who walks into a town that’s already dead and starts cataloguing the evidence?”</p>
<p>“A librarian,” James said immediately. “Or an archivist. Someone trained to impose order on other people’s chaos. Someone who processes information for a living and cannot stop processing even when the information is telling her to leave.”</p>
<p>“Her,” King said. “Good. A woman. Sixty-something, retired, widowed maybe. Came back to this town she left forty years ago because someone asked her to sort through a dead man’s papers. She’s good at sorting. She’s been sorting her whole life. Filing things in the right drawer and closing it. And now she’s in a house full of papers that won’t stay filed.”</p>
<p>“The dead man’s papers are the mechanism,” James said. “Among them, the evidence of what was buried and what was done. A survey. A genealogy. The record of a covenant broken.”</p>
<p>“And the dead man is the Paxton figure,” I said. “The one who dug it up.”</p>
<p>“Not quite Paxton.” James frowned, and the fluorescent light caught the edge of his glasses. “Paxton was young and foolish and driven by a collector’s greed. This man — the dead historian — was meticulous. Scholarly. He understood, perhaps, the significance of what he’d found. He simply could not resist the compulsion to complete his research. The scholar’s curse: the belief that understanding a thing gives you power over it.”</p>
<p>King shook his head. “Understanding gives you nothing. That’s the lesson. You dig it up, you catalogue it, you write it all down in your little notebook with your perfect handwriting, and the thing you dug up doesn’t care. The thing you dug up didn’t even notice you were there.”</p>
<p>“Now that,” James said, “is something I recognize.”</p>
<p>I asked about the guardian — the Harker figure, the last of the family line, the one who kept custody until the line ended. Was he a ghost? A presence? A metaphor?</p>
<p>“Not a metaphor,” King said. “I hate metaphors in horror. The minute the reader thinks the ghost is a metaphor, the ghost stops being scary. A ghost is a dead person who is still there. That’s it. That’s the whole deal.”</p>
<p>“I would complicate that,” James said. “The ghost in my work is rarely simply a dead person persisting. It is an obligation persisting. The last Ager on the path behind Paxton is not haunting Paxton out of malice. He is performing his function. He is the custody made visible. The question of whether he is ‘there’ in the way a living person is there is, to me, beside the point.”</p>
<p>“It’s not beside the point to the woman in the house,” King said. “If she sees something in the backyard — a figure standing among the trees — she doesn’t think, ‘Ah, an obligation persisting.’ She thinks, ‘Jesus Christ, there’s someone in my yard.’ And then she thinks, ‘Wait. The motion-sensor light didn’t come on.’”</p>
<p>I wrote that down. King saw me write it and pointed at my notebook.</p>
<p>“That’s the detail. That’s where the story lives. Not in the covenant or the genealogy or the lead casket. In the motion-sensor light that doesn’t trigger. Because that’s a thing a real person notices. That’s a thing that keeps a real person awake at three in the morning.”</p>
<p>“And the covenant and the genealogy are what give it weight,” James said. “Without the history, without the document, the motion-sensor light is merely a malfunction. With the document, it becomes evidence. The reader understands that something is standing in the yard that the light cannot see, or will not see, and that this something has been standing in yards — different yards, the same coast — for three hundred years.”</p>
<p>They were both right. They were both right in ways that excluded each other, and the story would have to hold both truths without resolving them. The domestic detail and the antiquarian weight. The Dunkin’ coffee and the lead casket. The motion-sensor light and the 1683 survey.</p>
<p>“What about the ending?” I asked.</p>
<p>King looked at James. James looked at the burnt coffee machine. Neither of them said anything for a long time.</p>
<p>“She leaves,” King said finally. “She gets in her car and she drives south and she doesn’t stop until she’s somewhere with people in it. And on the way out she passes all those dark houses and she knows — not suspects, not fears, knows — that the town is empty. Not dead. Empty. Whatever was in the ground moved through it like a tide and pulled every living thing out. Lights still on. Cars still in driveways. The dog that barked once when she arrived doesn’t bark when she leaves.”</p>
<p>“And the ground?”</p>
<p>“Still there. Still sealed, because she put the casket back. She did the right thing. She kept custody for one night. But it was already too late.”</p>
<p>“That is rather bleak,” James said.</p>
<p>“You wrote ‘A Warning to the Curious.’ You killed Paxton on a beach.”</p>
<p>“I killed Paxton because he took the crown. His death has a moral logic — the transgressor is punished. What you’re describing has no moral logic at all. The woman does the right thing and it doesn’t matter. The town is already gone. The custodian’s line failed fifty years ago and nobody noticed.”</p>
<p>“That’s what I want,” King said. “That’s the horror. Not that evil is punished or that transgressors die. That the whole system just broke and nobody was paying attention. Like a levy that failed upstream and the flood already came through while everyone was watching TV.”</p>
<p>James straightened his cuffs. An unconscious gesture, I thought, but one that bought him time. “I do not write stories where the moral order is entirely absent. Even in my bleakest work, there is a structure of consequence. Perhaps the story needs — and I offer this reluctantly — the suggestion that the guardian is still there. That the custody, however failed, however past its usefulness, persists in some form. A figure among the pines. Not protective. Not vengeful. Simply… remaining.”</p>
<p>“An obligation that outlived its purpose,” I said.</p>
<p>“If you must put it that way.”</p>
<p>King stood up. His chair scraped on the concrete floor with a sound that traveled through my teeth. “I need a real coffee,” he said. “The gas station’s still open. You want anything?”</p>
<p>James declined. I asked for whatever they had.</p>
<p>When King left, the room was quieter than it should have been. The Mr. Coffee machine had stopped making its sound. The fluorescent light had steadied. James sat with his hands folded, looking at the far wall where someone had taped a Sunday school poster — a cartoon ark with smiling animals. An odd thing to look at in the context of our conversation. A boat full of survivors. Everything else drowned.</p>
<p>“He’s right about the motion-sensor light,” James said, not looking at me. “That’s the detail I would never have found. My horror lives in documents and inscriptions and figures glimpsed at a distance. His lives in the thing that should work and doesn’t. The ordinary mechanism that fails in the presence of the extraordinary. I don’t know how to write that.”</p>
<p>“You don’t have to,” I said. “I do.”</p>
<p>He looked at me then, and for a moment his expression was not scholarly or restrained. It was something closer to relief — the look of a man handing off a weight he’s carried a long time, not because it’s too heavy but because it belongs to someone else now.</p>
<p>“Then make sure the light stays dark,” he said. “Whatever else you do. Make sure the reader understands that the light saw what was there, and chose not to respond.”</p>
<p>I heard King’s boots on the stairs, coming back down. The fluorescent tube began its flicker again. I closed my notebook.</p>
<p>The coffee, when it arrived, was terrible.</p> </section> <div class="meeting-footer" data-astro-cid-uzeevf5o> <div class="meeting-footer__nav" data-astro-cid-uzeevf5o> <a href="/read/custody-of-the-sealed-ground/" class="meeting-footer__link meeting-footer__link--primary" data-astro-cid-uzeevf5o>
