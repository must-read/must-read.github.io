James</p> <time datetime="2026-02-21" data-astro-cid-uzeevf5o>February 20, 2026</time> <hr class="header-divider" data-astro-cid-uzeevf5o> </header> <section class="reading-content" data-astro-cid-uzeevf5o> <p>The pub was called The Ploughman, which I thought was too on-the-nose for a conversation about folk horror until King pointed out that every pub in rural England is called The Ploughman or The Lamb or The Crown, and that the predictability was the point. “That’s what these places bank on,” he said. “You walk in and you know where you are. The brass taps, the horse brasses on the beam, the carpet that smells like forty years of spilled lager. It’s a liturgy.” He was drinking a pint of something dark and had already eaten half a packet of salt and vinegar crisps. James sat across from him with a half of bitter that he had not touched, his hands folded on the scarred tabletop, and regarded the horse brasses with an expression I could only describe as distaste held in careful abeyance.</p>
<p>“Liturgy is rather strong,” James said.</p>
<p>“Ritual, then. Same muscle.”</p>
<p>“It is not the same muscle at all. A liturgy implies belief. A ritual may persist long after belief has gone. That distinction matters enormously for the kind of story we are discussing.”</p>
<p>I had my notebook open and a pen in my hand and nothing written down, because they had been doing this for twenty minutes and I had not found a way in. The conversation had started in the car park, when King emerged from a rented Ford and James appeared — I cannot say from where exactly, only that he was suddenly standing by the pub door as though he had been there all afternoon, which was unsettling in a way I chose not to examine.</p>
<p>“Can I ask about the community?” I said. “Because the thing I keep circling is how the warmth works. The town has to feel genuinely warm. Not sinister-from-the-start. The reader has to want to live there.”</p>
<p>“Yes,” King said, leaning forward. “Goddamn right. That’s the whole game. I’ve written a hundred small towns and the ones that work are the ones where you get the diner smell right, the booth where your coffee’s already poured before you sit down, the guy who argues about the Sox even though the Sox are terrible and you both know it. That stuff isn’t decoration. It’s the mechanism. You have to make the reader fall in love with the town so that when the town turns out to be —” He waved the crisp packet. “You know. Doing what it’s doing. The reader feels it in their stomach. Not because they’re scared of the town. Because they’re scared of how much they wanted it.”</p>
<p>James adjusted his spectacles. “I take your point about warmth, though I would frame it differently. The horror is not that the community deceives the outsider. The horror is that the community is entirely sincere. They are warm because they are warm. They welcome because they welcome. And the welcome happens to be, in this case, a step in a process that ends badly.”</p>
<p>“Exactly,” King said.</p>
<p>“We agree, then, though your version involves considerably more detail about breakfast.” The faintest ghost of a smile. James took his first sip of bitter and set it down precisely on the same wet ring it had left before. “My concern is that we shall be tempted to write the outsider as a fool. The academic who ignores the signs. The rational man who dismisses what’s in front of him. That figure is a staple and I find him contemptible. Not because he’s rational — rationality is admirable — but because the story so often cheats. It makes the signs obvious to the reader and obscure to the protagonist, and the gap between their understanding is supposed to generate suspense but in fact generates only irritation.”</p>
<p>This was the first real tension, and I felt it land. King was nodding, but his jaw had set in the way it does when he agrees with the premise and disagrees with the implication.</p>
<p>“So you don’t want a dumb protagonist,” he said. “Fine. Neither do I. But Monty, the guy has to miss something. That’s the architecture. The Wicker Man doesn’t work if Howie figures it out in the first reel.”</p>
<p>“Howie does not figure it out because the community’s logic is internally complete and he is excluded from it. Not because he is stupid. Because their system has no gaps that his system can exploit. He investigates beautifully. He is a competent man applying the wrong frame. That is very different from a fool who ignores a warning.”</p>
<p>“Okay, so how does our guy — our folklorist, whoever he is — how does he miss it?”</p>
<p>“He doesn’t miss it,” James said, and his voice took on the particular precision I recognized from his stories, the tone that sounds like a man reading a document aloud in a quiet room. “He finds it. He finds exactly what is there. That is the structure I would advocate. The protagonist is a scholar. He enters the archive. He reads what the archive contains. He understands perfectly well what the documents describe. And it does him no good whatsoever, because understanding is not the same as exemption.”</p>
<p>I wrote that down. Understanding is not exemption. It felt like the spine of something.</p>
<p>“But there has to be a moment where he could leave,” King said. “That’s the thing about folk horror that James here” — he gestured with the crisp packet — “the Jamesian tradition doesn’t always bother with. The locked door. The moment where you realize you can walk away, and you don’t, and the reason you don’t is the interesting part. In The Wicker Man, Howie could leave. He could get back on the bloody plane. He doesn’t because he’s looking for a missing girl. Noble motive. In Harvest Home, Ned could leave, but he doesn’t because he’s bought the house and he’s invested and honestly the corn is growing great and his wife is happier than she’s been in years. Ignoble motive. Both work.”</p>
<p>“And which do you prefer for our man?”</p>
<p>“The ignoble one. Every time. The guy who stays because it feels good. Because the diner lady knows his eggs. Because someone fixed his lamp. Because he hasn’t been listened to like this in years and he’s lonely and the loneliness is the thing that kills him, not the bonfire.”</p>
<p>James was quiet for a moment. He turned his pint glass a quarter rotation. “You are describing something I recognize,” he said slowly. “Not from fiction. From academic life. The visiting scholar who arrives at a new institution and is suddenly, after years of being ignored, taken seriously. Given a room. Introduced to people. It is — I will grant you this — narcotic. And the withdrawal, when it comes, is acute.”</p>
<p>“That’s it. That’s the trap.”</p>
<p>“But I resist your word ‘narcotic,’” James said, “because it implies the warmth is a drug, which implies the community is a dealer, which makes the whole thing a transaction. And transactions can be refused. What frightens me more — what I think is the colder idea — is that the warmth is not transactional. The warmth is real. The community genuinely cares for the man. They are genuinely glad he is there. And they will genuinely kill him, and those two things are not in contradiction. That is the folk horror premise, is it not? That the sacrifice is not a perversion of the community but an expression of it.”</p>
<p>I felt something shift in the room. Not literally — the pub was the same, the horse brasses still gleaming dully, someone feeding coins into the fruit machine in the corner — but the quality of the conversation changed. King sat back. He pulled at his lower lip, which I’d read he does when something surprises him.</p>
<p>“That’s colder than anything I’d write,” he said. “I’d want the protagonist to see a crack in the warmth. A moment where someone looks at him too long, or a conversation stops when he walks in, or — I don’t know — a woman’s hands are red and he notices the redness and it means something later. Because my people need handles. My readers need to be able to say, ‘I saw it, I caught it, that’s the moment where it turned.’ And your version, Monty, doesn’t have that moment. Your version is the warmth all the way down and the knife at the end, and the reader is supposed to understand that the warmth and the knife are the same gesture.”</p>
<p>“Yes,” James said simply.</p>
<p>“And you think that works in four thousand words?”</p>
<p>“I think it works better in four thousand words than in four hundred pages. The Jamesian ghost story — if I may speak of my own work without too much embarrassment — derives its effect from compression. A document is found. A phrase is read. Something follows. The reader has no time to organize defenses. Your mode” — he indicated King’s half of the table as though it were a territory — “is the long siege. You build the town brick by brick, and the reader has moved in by page fifty, and then you start pulling bricks out. Both approaches have merit. For this particular story, I would advocate for the document.”</p>
<p>“What document?”</p>
<p>“That is the question, isn’t it.” James sat forward now, hands still folded but his posture different — engaged, almost eager, in a way that looked uncharacteristic and therefore genuine. “The folklorist enters the archive. The archive contains a record. Year after year the same entry, the same formula, a kind of liturgy — you’ll forgive the word. And somewhere in the margins of the official record, a dissenting voice. A hand that wrote what the main text would not. That dissenting hand is the Jamesian horror: the scholar’s nightmare of finding the note that undoes the document, the gloss that says the opposite of the text.”</p>
<p>“The marginalia,” I said, and it came out almost involuntarily.</p>
<p>“The marginalia,” James confirmed. “You are paying attention.”</p>
<p>King was leaning forward again. “Okay. Okay, I’m with you on the marginalia, that’s good, that’s the cold part. But I want the hot part too. I want the corned beef hash. I want the woman who brings cookies. I want the guy who lends a reading lamp from his own damn house. Because the marginalia is the proof, right, it’s the evidence — but the hash and the cookies and the lamp are why the evidence doesn’t matter. The evidence doesn’t save you because you’ve already been saved by the town. That’s the trap.”</p>
<p>“We keep agreeing,” James observed dryly. “I find it uncomfortable.”</p>
<p>“So do I. Let’s find something to fight about.” King drained the last of his pint. “Fire. What does the fire do?”</p>
<p>“The fire is the sacrifice,” I said, and immediately regretted how reductive it sounded.</p>
<p>“No,” James said, and King said “Maybe” at the same time, and they looked at each other.</p>
<p>“Fire in folk horror is purification,” King said. “That’s The Wicker Man. The big burning. It’s spectacular, it’s visual, it’s the thing everyone remembers. And it’s — look, there’s a reason cultures burn things. Fire gets rid of fire. You burn the field to make it grow. You burn the old man to bring the spring. It’s sympathetic magic and it’s as old as anything we’ve got.”</p>
<p>“And you want the fire in this story.”</p>
<p>“I want the idea of the fire. The bonfire they build every October. I want it to be beautiful. I want the reader to picture it and think: I would go to that. I would stand at the edge of that fire and drink cider and watch the sparks go up and feel like I belonged somewhere.”</p>
<p>“And then someone goes into it.”</p>
<p>“And then someone goes into it.”</p>
<p>James shook his head, slowly but not in disagreement — more as if he were trying to dislodge something that had attached itself. “I resist the spectacle. I have always resisted the spectacle. The ghost in my stories is glimpsed, never displayed. The terrible thing happens offstage, or in a subordinate clause, or in a document read too late by candlelight. If we put a man in a bonfire, I shall want to look away.”</p>
<p>“That’s the point.”</p>
<p>“No. I mean literally. I shall want to write around it. To place the fire in a marginal note, in a church record — ‘the fire burned clean’ — and let the reader supply what that means. The phrase ‘the fire burned clean’ is more terrible than any description of what burning looks like, because the cleanliness is the obscenity. It implies that sometimes the fire does not burn clean. And what does that look like? I do not want to say. I want the reader to lie awake and wonder.”</p>
<p>There was a long pause. The fruit machine played a little cascade of electronic notes — someone had won, or more likely lost in a way that sounded like winning. I ate one of King’s crisps.</p>
<p>“You’re right,” King said, and it clearly cost him something. “The fire burned clean. Jesus. That’s four words and it does more than any pyre scene I could write.” He paused. “But we need the warmth. I keep coming back to it. The fire that’s the sacrifice and the fire in the woodstove at the diner and the fire in the reading lamp the hardware man lends you — those are all the same fire. The community’s warmth. And the warmth is real and the fire is real and they’re the same thing.”</p>
<p>“And fire as both giving and taking,” I said, finding my footing. “The valley ‘gives well’ and the fire ‘burns clean.’ But giving is also what the valley demands. The crops give. And a life is given. It’s the same word doing opposite work.”</p>
<p>King pointed at me. “That. Write that down.”</p>
<p>“I did.”</p>
<p>“The double valence of ‘giving,’” James murmured, and I could see the idea working behind his eyes, being turned over and examined the way he might examine a questionable inscription. “Yes. That is good. The official record uses the word innocently. The marginal record uses it with the other meaning. And both are correct.”</p>
<p>“What about women?” King said abruptly. “In Harvest Home, the women run everything. The men think they run it. The women let them think that. And the real power, the real knowledge, is passed from mother to daughter and the men are — I don’t know — equipment. Background. The women decide who lives and who dies and they’ve been deciding for two hundred years and they don’t agonize about it. They just do it.”</p>
<p>“You admire this,” James said, and it was not a question.</p>
<p>“I find it terrifying. Which is different from admiring it, but only just.” King paused. “The woman who runs the archive. The town clerk. She should be the keeper. Not the monster — there’s no monster — but the mechanism. The person who maintains the calendar. Her mother maintained it. Her grandmother. All the way back.”</p>
<p>“And she is kind,” James said.</p>
<p>“And she is kind. And she means it.”</p>
<p>James picked up his glass again. He drank, set it down. “I have one disagreement I wish to register, and then I believe we have said enough. The ending. You will want the protagonist to escape. You will want the midnight drive, the highway, the narrow margin. It is your instinct and it is not wrong for your kind of story. But for this story — for the folk horror story — the escape must not work. Not in the obvious way. The man may leave the valley. He may drive to a city and lock his door and call the authorities. But the valley must follow. Not as a pursuer. As a condition. He was in the calendar. He ate the food and slept in the valley and his name was written down, and I do not think geography is sufficient to undo that kind of inscription.”</p>
<p>“So he gets out but he doesn’t get out.”</p>
<p>“He gets out but he cannot be certain he has gotten out. Which is worse.”</p>
<p>King looked at him for a long time. The pub had emptied around us — I had not noticed when, which seemed wrong, though perhaps people simply leave pubs at a certain hour and I had been too absorbed to mark it. The barman was drying glasses. Outside the window, the fields were dark, and I could see, at the far edge of the car park, the treeline, and the treeline was very still, and I thought about what James had said about the fire burned clean and what King had said about the warmth being real and I realized I was counting the horse brasses on the beam above our table. There were seven. I counted again. There were eight. I did not count a third time.</p>
<p>“I want to ask about the ending,” I said, “but I think you’ve just told me it.”</p>
<p>“I’ve told you one version,” James said. “Mr. King has another, and you will have a third, and none of them will be precisely right, which is as it should be.” He stood, collected his coat from the back of the chair. “The trick with folk horror is that the community is always right. Their ritual works. The crops grow. The town survives. Two hundred years of evidence supports them. The outsider arrives with his modern objections and his rational frame and his mobile telephone, and the community is still right, and he is still in the calendar, and the fire will still burn.” He buttoned his coat with the precise movements of a man who has done the same thing in the same order ten thousand times. “Whether it burns clean is another matter.”</p>
<p>King stood too. He crumpled the crisp packet and left it on the table. “One more thing,” he said. “The smell. When he drives into town for the first time, there’s a smell. Cut grass and something sweet underneath, like apples fermenting. And at the end, back in his apartment in Burlington or wherever, he can’t eat apples. The smell makes him sick. That’s the valley. It’s in him. You don’t have to explain it. You just have to get the smell right.”</p>
<p>They left separately — King through the front, James through a side door I had not previously noticed. I sat alone at the table with my notebook and my cold pint and I counted the horse brasses one more time. Seven. I wrote that down.</p>
<p>The barman came over to collect the glasses. “Just you, then?” he said.</p>
<p>“Just me,” I said, and the way he nodded — slowly, appraisingly, as if confirming something he had already decided — stayed with me the whole drive back.</p> </section> <div class="meeting-footer" data-astro-cid-uzeevf5o> <div class="meeting-footer__nav" data-astro-cid-uzeevf5o> <a href="/read/kindling-night/" class="meeting-footer__link meeting-footer__link--primary" data-astro-cid-uzeevf5o>
