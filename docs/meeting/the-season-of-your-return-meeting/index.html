Jemisin</p> <time datetime="2026-02-21" data-astro-cid-uzeevf5o>February 20, 2026</time> <hr class="header-divider" data-astro-cid-uzeevf5o> </header> <section class="reading-content" data-astro-cid-uzeevf5o> <p>The coffee shop was underground, which Jemisin had chosen on purpose. She admitted this with a shrug when Butler raised an eyebrow at the stairs descending from the sidewalk into a basement establishment in Harlem with exposed brick walls and pipes running along the ceiling. “I wanted us below the surface,” Jemisin said. “Sue me.”</p>
<p>Butler ordered black coffee and sat with her back to the wall. I noticed she’d chosen the seat that gave her sightlines to both the entrance and the kitchen. A survival habit, maybe. Or a writer’s habit — the same thing, probably, for her.</p>
<p>I had my notebook open before either of them spoke. I already knew I was going to write about stolen knowledge, about the earth’s memory, about bodies that carry expertise that predates the institutions claiming ownership of it. I had notes. I had an outline. I had a confident sense of what the story wanted to be.</p>
<p>That lasted about four minutes.</p>
<p>“The problem with geological metaphors,” Butler said, stirring her coffee with a deliberation that made the gesture feel surgical, “is that people use them to avoid talking about flesh. ‘Fault lines in society.’ ‘Seismic shifts in culture.’ All of this tectonic language deployed so no one has to say the word <em>body</em>. What happened to bodies. What continues to happen to bodies.”</p>
<p>“But the earth is a body,” Jemisin said. She had ordered something with oat milk and was holding the cup in both hands though the basement wasn’t cold. “That’s not a metaphor. The planet has a skin, a mantle, a core. It has wounds that don’t close. The New Madrid zone — you know about this? The earthquakes of 1811 and 1812, the ground literally liquefied, the Mississippi ran backward. Two hundred years later, the fault is still stressed. The earth does not heal on a human timescale.”</p>
<p>“Fine. But the story isn’t about the earth.”</p>
<p>“The story is about the earth and the people in it simultaneously. That’s the whole point.”</p>
<p>Butler set down her spoon. “Then you need to pick one.”</p>
<p>I looked up from my notebook. “Why?”</p>
<p>“Because a reader can only be in one body at a time.” She said this flatly, not unkindly, the way you’d explain gravity to someone who kept trying to build a house on a cliff. “You can give them a woman’s body. You can give them the earth’s body. You cannot give them both and expect either to land with the force it needs. Human suffering becomes decoration on a geology lesson. Or geology becomes decoration on human suffering. Either way, something gets diminished.”</p>
<p>Jemisin leaned back in her chair. “I disagree completely, and you know I disagree, because we’ve had this argument before in every book we’ve ever written separately.”</p>
<p>“We haven’t had any arguments. We’ve never met.”</p>
<p>“Our work has met. And your work says: put the reader in a body, one body, make them feel every bruise and blister, and the politics will emerge from the flesh. My work says: build the system first — the geological, the civilizational, the cosmic — and then put the body inside it, and the system itself becomes a kind of character.”</p>
<p>“That’s a fair summary,” Butler said. “And I still think you’re wrong.”</p>
<p>“I know you do.”</p>
<p>I turned to a fresh page. My outline was already useless. “What if the protagonist is a scientist?” I said. “A geologist. Someone whose job is literally to read the earth.”</p>
<p>Butler didn’t answer immediately. She was watching the pipes on the ceiling, following a line of copper that disappeared into the brick. “A Black woman geologist,” she said. “In a city built on engineered instability. And the engineering — the deep drilling, the injection wells, the controlled fracturing — was originally mapped by enslaved people. She discovers this.”</p>
<p>“That’s good,” Jemisin said. “That’s the connection. The knowledge didn’t originate with the institution that claims it.”</p>
<p>“But discovery is too clean,” Butler said. “Discovery is a white genre. Columbus <em>discovered</em>. Lewis and Clark <em>discovered</em>. I don’t want this woman to discover anything. I want the knowledge to come back into her body whether she wants it or not. Through the body. Not through an archive, not through research, not through a revelatory document in an old trunk. Through her <em>flesh</em>.”</p>
<p>This is where it got difficult for me. “So — time travel? Her body displaces into a past body?”</p>
<p>Butler gave me a look I can only describe as patient disappointment. “Time travel is a mechanism. What I’m describing is a condition. The difference matters. Dana in <em>Kindred</em> doesn’t choose to travel. She doesn’t operate a machine. Her body is <em>claimed</em> by the past. The past reaches up and takes her because the past is not over, and her body is the proof that it isn’t over. She is the continuity.”</p>
<p>“The involuntary aspect is everything,” Jemisin said, and I could see her excitement, the way it made her lean forward and grip the cup harder. “Because when it’s voluntary, when there’s a time machine or a portal or a choice, the reader gets to think: <em>I would choose differently.</em> When it’s involuntary, the reader has no escape. The story is happening <em>to</em> you.”</p>
<p>“Which is why,” Jemisin continued, and I could tell from Butler’s expression that she knew what was coming, “the story has to be in second person.”</p>
<p>Butler sighed. Not theatrically. A real sigh, heavy and resigned. “You and your second person.”</p>
<p>“It works for this. You just said you want the reader’s body to be the site. Second person puts the reader there. ‘You feel the clay under your feet. You smell the tallow. Your hands are bleeding.’ There’s nowhere to hide.”</p>
<p>“Second person is a trick.”</p>
<p>“All narration is a trick.”</p>
<p>“Second person is a more aggressive trick. It tells the reader what they feel instead of showing them a character who feels it and trusting them to empathize. You’re replacing empathy with conscription.”</p>
<p>Jemisin set her cup down with a click. “Empathy is a luxury not everyone can afford. Empathy says: <em>I can imagine your pain from a safe distance.</em> Second person says: <em>This is your pain now. Deal with it.</em> For a story about Black bodies and stolen knowledge and a history that reaches into the present and grabs you — empathy isn’t enough. I don’t want the reader to empathize with this woman. I want them to <em>be</em> her.”</p>
<p>The silence that followed was the kind that has texture. I could feel both of them thinking, and I could feel the space between their positions, and I knew — I knew before Butler spoke — that she was going to concede, and that the concession would cost her something.</p>
<p>“Fine,” Butler said. “Second person. But you earn it. You don’t start in second person because it’s stylish. You start there because the story cannot be told any other way. And you’d better make the physical sensation so specific, so granular, so located in a particular body in a particular moment, that the ‘you’ feels like a proper name, not a pronoun. If I read ‘you feel a sense of dread,’ I’m done. If I read ‘the calluses on your palms crack open against the shovel handle and the blood is the color of the clay,’ maybe. Maybe.”</p>
<p>I wrote that down. I wrote it down exactly. The calluses. The clay. I didn’t know yet what it meant for the story’s architecture, but I could feel it in my own hands, which is how I know when something is true.</p>
<p>“Now,” Butler said, turning to me with a directness that made my pen stop moving, “talk to me about the institution. This Bureau she works for. What does it look like?”</p>
<p>“I was thinking — a geological compliance agency. Monitoring the injection wells, managing substrate stability. She’s senior staff, respected, technically accomplished. The kind of position that means something specific when you’re a Black woman holding it.”</p>
<p>“Means she’s the best, and they still think of her as probationary,” Butler said. “Means she’s three times as credentialed as the man running the place. Means she goes home to the neighborhood the Bureau neglects.”</p>
<p>“She lives in the Freedmen’s Quarter,” I said. “The oldest neighborhood, built on the original survey site. Lowest rents, worst infrastructure.”</p>
<p>“The place named for the people they’d rather forget built it.” Butler nodded. “Good. And the man running the Bureau — his family has run it for generations?”</p>
<p>“Three. Grandfather to father to son.”</p>
<p>“Of course. And the grandfather’s name is on the geological surveys that were actually produced by enslaved labor.”</p>
<p>“Sullivan,” I said.</p>
<p>“The name doesn’t matter. What matters is the lineage. The clean line of inheritance from theft to respectability to institutional authority. Every geological paper, every patent, every compliance metric — all of it sourced from knowledge that was extracted alongside the labor, and then scrubbed clean of its origins.”</p>
<p>Jemisin had been quiet for a while, which I’d learned was how she processed. She processes in silence and then delivers something fully formed, like a geode cracked open. “The question I keep coming back to,” she said, “is whether the earth itself is an archive or an agent.”</p>
<p>I blinked. “What’s the difference?”</p>
<p>“An archive stores. An agent acts. If the earth is an archive, the story is about a woman who discovers a record — she reads the fault lines, finds the buried history, pieces together what was stolen. That’s a detective story. Compelling, but a detective story. If the earth is an agent, the earth is <em>doing</em> something. It’s pulling her into the past. It’s choosing her. The ground has been waiting for someone who can read both its languages — the modern seismology and the older body-knowledge — and it reaches up and claims her. That’s a different kind of story.”</p>
<p>“It’s not an archive,” Butler said, and for the first time her voice had something other than certainty in it. Something closer to awe, which I hadn’t expected from her. “The earth is not passive. Geology is not passive. An earthquake is not information — it’s action. The ground moves. It destroys. It rearranges. If these enslaved geologists put their knowledge into the earth — mapped it, shaped it, managed the fractures with their bodies and their understanding — then the earth is not storing that knowledge like a book. The earth is performing it. Still. Right now. The Freedmen’s Quarter is still standing because the fracture management that was done in the 1830s is still working. The ground remembers because the ground is still doing what those people taught it to do.”</p>
<p>She stopped. She looked at Jemisin. “Maybe you were right about the system being a character.”</p>
<p>Jemisin didn’t gloat. She took a sip of her coffee, which must have been cold by now. “The question that still bothers me is what Dara does with the knowledge. With the record she’s building in secret.”</p>
<p>“She writes it down,” I said. “She starts a document. A complete geological history attributing the original knowledge to the enslaved surveyors.”</p>
<p>“And then what?” Jemisin pressed. “She publishes it? Brings down the Sullivan dynasty? Gets justice?”</p>
<p>“Justice is a resolution,” Butler said. “We’re not writing a resolution.”</p>
<p>“No. We’re not.” Jemisin rubbed her temple. “But you can’t end with her just sitting there typing, either. That’s a TED talk ending. Woman learns truth, woman writes truth, roll credits.”</p>
<p>“She’s sitting on the floor,” I said, surprising myself. I hadn’t planned this detail. “She’s in her apartment in the Freedmen’s Quarter and she’s sitting on the floor with her back against the wall and her palms flat on the concrete. And she can feel the limestone underneath. And she starts writing. And the ground warms under her hands.”</p>
<p>“The ground acknowledges her,” Jemisin said.</p>
<p>“Or the ground is tired,” Butler said. “The ground has been doing this work — holding, managing, keeping the city from falling into its own foundations — for almost two hundred years, with no relief, no recognition, no rotation of labor. The ground, which is the people, which is the knowledge, says: <em>I have been holding this for you. It is your season now.</em>”</p>
<p>Something moved through the three of us. I don’t know how to describe it except as a frequency — the way you feel a bass note in your chest before your ears register the sound. We all felt it. Jemisin set down her cup. Butler uncrossed her arms. I stopped writing.</p>
<p>“The season of your return,” Jemisin said. “That’s the title.”</p>
<p>Butler frowned. “It starts with ‘The.’”</p>
<p>“It starts with <em>the</em> because it has to. Because ‘Season of Your Return’ sounds like a greeting card. The article matters here — it’s specific. Not <em>a</em> season. <em>The</em> season. The one that was always coming. The one the ground has been waiting for.”</p>
<p>I wrote the title down. It felt inevitable, which is how the good ones always feel — like you didn’t invent them, like they were already there and you just finally noticed.</p>
<p>“The thing I’m not willing to surrender,” Butler said, and I could hear that she was wrapping something up, that the conversation had gone where she needed it to go and she was marking her territory one final time before we moved on, “is that this woman is not saved by the knowledge. She is not elevated by the discovery. She goes back to work the next day. Sullivan is still her boss. The Freedmen’s Quarter still has the worst infrastructure in the city. The eastern grid injection wells will lose pressure again, and again, and the response will be the same institutional shrug. The truth does not set her free. The truth gives her an obligation she did not ask for and cannot discharge.”</p>
<p>“Agreed,” Jemisin said. “But the truth also gives her company. She is not alone in the tunnel. The woman with the iron rod looks at her. <em>Sees</em> her. Across two hundred years, someone sees Dara Okafor, and the seeing is not metaphorical. It is direct. Eye to eye. Body to body. The dead are not symbols. They are colleagues.”</p>
<p>“Colleagues she can’t cite,” Butler said. “Colleagues with no names in the record.”</p>
<p>“Which is why she’s writing the document. To give them names.”</p>
<p>“She doesn’t have their names.”</p>
<p>“She has the work. She can cite the work. The fracture patterns, the survey grids, the geological knowledge that preceded the institution by decades. She can say: this work was done, by these hands, in this place, at this time. That is a kind of name.”</p>
<p>Butler considered this. I could see her turning it over, testing its weight. “A kind of name,” she repeated. “Not a name. A kind of name.”</p>
<p>“Is that enough?” I asked.</p>
<p>Neither of them answered. Jemisin looked at the exposed brick behind Butler’s head, her eyes tracing the mortar lines between the stones. Butler looked at her coffee, which she had stopped drinking two digressions ago. I looked at my notebook, which was full of fragments and arrows and underlined words — <em>calluses</em>, <em>tallow</em>, <em>liquefaction</em>, <em>the same grid</em>, <em>the same mark</em> — and which was not an outline and not a plan and not a story, but was the soil from which a story might, if I was careful and lucky and willing to let these two women’s disagreements live inside me without resolving them, eventually grow.</p>
<p>“I want to go back to something,” Jemisin said. “The Bureau’s survey mark. The two interlocking circles with the vertical line. If Dara sees that mark in the old tunnel — the same mark that’s on her uniform — what does that mean?”</p>
<p>“It means the institution stole the brand along with the knowledge,” Butler said. “They took the mark the enslaved surveyors used to tag their work and stamped it on their own letterhead.”</p>
<p>“Or it means the mark was always there. That it’s older than either institution — the plantation or the Bureau. That the people who understood this ground had their own system of notation, and the system survived because the knowledge survived, and the mark on Dara’s uniform is an inheritance she didn’t know she was carrying.”</p>
<p>“Those are two very different stories.”</p>
<p>“They are. I don’t think we need to choose.”</p>
<p>Butler looked at Jemisin for a long time. “You always want to leave the door open. Multiple interpretations. The reader decides.”</p>
<p>“You always want to close it. The body knows. The flesh is certain.”</p>
<p>“The flesh <em>is</em> certain. Scars don’t have multiple interpretations.”</p>
<p>“But their causes might.”</p>
<p>I closed my notebook. Not because the conversation was over — I could feel three more hours of argument coiling in the space between them — but because I had what I needed, and more than what I needed, and I was afraid that if I stayed much longer I would start trying to resolve the contradictions instead of carrying them. The story needed both: Butler’s insistence on the body’s certainty, the scar that means exactly one thing; and Jemisin’s insistence on systemic ambiguity, the mark that could be theft or inheritance or both. The protagonist would have to live inside that tension. She would not get to decide. Neither would the reader.</p>
<p>Butler finished her cold coffee in one long swallow and set the cup down precisely in the center of its saucer. Jemisin was already standing, pulling on her coat, saying something about the New Madrid seismic zone and how the Army Corps of Engineers had been managing it since the 1960s without acknowledging — but I lost the rest of it in the scrape of chairs and the noise of the coffee grinder behind the counter.</p>
<p>At the foot of the stairs leading back up to the street, Jemisin paused and looked back at me. “One more thing. The woman in the tunnel, the one with the iron rod who manages the fractures — she doesn’t speak in words. She speaks in vibration. Through the stone. Felt in the bones. Because the language that matters most is the one that doesn’t need air to travel.”</p>
<p>Butler was already halfway up the stairs. Over her shoulder, without turning around: “Make sure it hurts.”</p> </section> <div class="meeting-footer" data-astro-cid-uzeevf5o> <div class="meeting-footer__nav" data-astro-cid-uzeevf5o> <a href="/read/the-season-of-your-return/" class="meeting-footer__link meeting-footer__link--primary" data-astro-cid-uzeevf5o>
