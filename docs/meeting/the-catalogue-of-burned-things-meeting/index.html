Somewhere in San Telmo, south of the tourist market, in the part of the barrio where the cobblestones still buckle from the roots of trees that were cut down decades ago. The sign above the door said LIBROS in hand-painted capitals, nothing else — no name, no hours — and the window display held a single volume propped open to a page of dense, foxed text, like a mouth trying to tell you something.</p>
<p>Zafón was already inside when I arrived. He was standing in the back, running his fingers along the spines of a shelf of clothbound novels from the forties and fifties, the old Sudamericana and Losada editions you find in every used bookshop in Buenos Aires, the ones with the brittle yellow pages and the smell of adhesive giving way. He picked up a volume, held it close to his face, inhaled.</p>
<p>“This one,” he said, not looking at me. “This one someone read in bed. You can tell from the bend of the spine — it opens naturally to the middle, the way a body does when it’s comfortable. Someone loved this book enough to fall asleep holding it.”</p>
<p>I sat down at a table near the window. The chairs were mismatched. A cat with one eye was asleep on a stack of newspapers. The shopkeeper, a woman in her seventies with reading glasses on a chain, was doing a crossword behind the register and had not acknowledged either of us.</p>
<p>“You’re romanticizing,” said Enríquez, coming through the door. She was carrying a paper cup of coffee and wore a leather jacket that was too warm for the weather. She sat across from me and set the coffee down on a copy of <em>Sur</em> from 1968 without looking at it. “You always romanticize. Someone read that book in bed. Or someone shoved it in a box in 1976 because the police were coming and they didn’t have time to choose what to save.”</p>
<p>Zafón turned around. He was smiling, but the smile had something guarded in it — the expression of a man who knows the argument he’s about to have and has decided to enjoy it.</p>
<p>“Both can be true,” he said.</p>
<p>“Both can be true, but they’re not the same story,” Enríquez said. “One is about love and the other is about terror and you can’t hold them at equal distance and call that nuance. One of them has a body count.”</p>
<p>I opened my notebook. I had written down some ideas on the subte ride over — archives, catalogues, the idea of a young woman finding something she wasn’t supposed to find in the basement of a library. I started to explain, but Zafón sat down beside me and took the notebook from my hands, gently, like you’d take a book from a child who was holding it by the wrong end.</p>
<p>“You’ve started with the plot,” he said. “Don’t start with the plot. Start with the building.”</p>
<p>“The building?”</p>
<p>“The Biblioteca Nacional,” he said. “You know it sits on the hill in Recoleta like a concrete fortress. Narrow windows. Brutalist. And beneath it — do you know what was there before?”</p>
<p>I did, actually. “The old presidential residence. Perón lived there.”</p>
<p>“And before that, the Penitentiary,” Enríquez cut in. “The National Penitentiary of Buenos Aires. They demolished it in the thirties, but the foundations are still down there. When it rains, water comes up through the basement floors. The building remembers what it’s built on even when nobody else does.”</p>
<p>Zafón leaned forward. “That’s exactly it. A library built on top of a prison. A place of knowledge sitting on a place of punishment. In Barcelona, we have this — the old city is layers, Roman walls under medieval churches under nineteenth-century apartments. You walk on the surface and underneath you is two thousand years of the dead. But Buenos Aires has something Barcelona doesn’t.”</p>
<p>“Which is?”</p>
<p>“The dead are closer,” Enríquez said flatly. “In Barcelona, the dead are medieval. Romantic. They’ve been dead long enough to become scenery. In Argentina the dead are from 1977. They’re your grandmother’s age. They’re not ghosts in a storybook sense — they’re absences that your mother won’t explain, and the explanation, when you finally get it, is worse than any ghost.”</p>
<p>There was a silence. The one-eyed cat shifted on its newspapers. I could hear traffic from the street, a bus grinding gears on the corner.</p>
<p>“I want to push back on that,” Zafón said carefully. “Not on the history — I would never presume. But on the idea that age diminishes haunting. A ghost from the fifteenth century and a ghost from 1977 are both ghosts. The ache is the same.”</p>
<p>“The ache is not the same.” Enríquez’s voice was quiet and precise, the way a scalpel is precise. “A fifteenth-century ghost is an aesthetic experience. You encounter it and you feel a pleasant melancholy, a sense of the long human past. A ghost from the dictatorship is your tía’s friend who was picked up from her apartment on a Tuesday afternoon and never came back, and thirty years later her daughter is still going to government offices with a file folder, and the file folder is the ghost. The paperwork is the ghost. The bureaucratic refusal to acknowledge that someone existed — that’s the haunting.”</p>
<p>I was writing fast. Something was forming, not a plot but a shape — the idea of paperwork as haunting, of bureaucratic absence as the true ghost story. I said something about catalogues, about how a library catalogue is a kind of census, a record of what exists.</p>
<p>“Yes,” Zafón said, and his eyes changed — that look writers get when an image lands in the right part of their brain. “A catalogue is a spell. In the Cemetery of Forgotten Books — you know my invention — every book that enters is recorded, and the record is what keeps it alive. If the record is destroyed, the book ceases to exist. Not physically — it’s still there on the shelf. But it becomes invisible. Unclaimed. The catalogue is the book’s birth certificate.”</p>
<p>“So what happens when someone destroys the catalogue on purpose?” I asked.</p>
<p>“That’s a library burning,” Enríquez said. “That’s what the juntas did. Not only physically burning books — though they did that, in the plaza, they burned books in public like it was 1933 — but erasing the records. Removing names from university registers. Disappearing people from the civil registry. You burn the catalogue and the person was never born.”</p>
<p>“But what if someone kept a copy?” I was thinking out loud now, the notebook forgotten. “What if someone — a librarian, an archivist, a woman in a house — kept her own catalogue of the things that were supposed to be destroyed?”</p>
<p>Zafón stood up and walked back to the shelves. He pulled out a volume — something slim, green cloth binding, the kind of notebook you’d use for household accounts. He held it up.</p>
<p>“This is what I want the story to feel like,” he said. “Not a novel. A ledger. Something that a woman kept in private, in her own handwriting, in a room behind a room. The most romantic object in the world is a secret record. A hidden list. A catalogue that was supposed to burn but didn’t.”</p>
<p>“It’s not romantic,” Enríquez said. “I need you to hear me when I say that. A woman hiding books from the junta is not romantic. It’s terrifying. She’s risking her life. She’s risking her family. Every time someone comes to the door she has to decide in three seconds whether to answer or to run.”</p>
<p>“I know that.”</p>
<p>“Do you? Because in your books, Carlos — and I say this with respect — the danger is beautiful. The labyrinth is beautiful. The mystery is seductive. You make the reader fall in love with the danger. And I’m saying that the danger in Argentina in 1977 was not beautiful. It was banal. It was a Ford Falcon pulling up to your house at four in the morning. It was a man in a suit writing your name in a ledger not to preserve it but to mark it for destruction.”</p>
<p>Zafón was quiet for a moment. He put the green notebook back on the shelf.</p>
<p>“You’re right,” he said, and it cost him. I could see it in the way his jaw tightened. “You’re right that beauty can be a kind of lie. That making the labyrinth seductive is a way of avoiding the fact that people were forced into it. I accept that. But I also think —” He paused. “I think the woman who kept the hidden catalogue was engaged in an act that was both terrifying and — I won’t say beautiful. I’ll say sacred. She was performing the oldest function of a library, which is to insist that the things inside it are real.”</p>
<p>Enríquez considered this. She picked up her coffee, drank, made a face — it had gone cold.</p>
<p>“Sacred is a word I can tolerate,” she said. “What I can’t tolerate is a story where the horror is the backdrop and the books are the foreground. In Argentina, the horror is the foreground. It’s always the foreground. The books matter because of the horror, not despite it.”</p>
<p>“What about the granddaughter?” I said. Both of them looked at me. “I keep coming back to the idea of someone finding this catalogue decades later. A young archivist. She works in the library, she opens a box of old donations, and she finds — her own family’s books. Her grandmother’s diary.”</p>
<p>“Good,” Enríquez said. “But she doesn’t find it romantically. She doesn’t gasp and hold it to her chest. She finds it the way you find a bill in the mail. It’s an object on a table and it changes your life and the room doesn’t look any different after.”</p>
<p>“I disagree,” Zafón said. “The room does look different. When you discover a book that changes everything, the room changes. The light changes. The architecture of your understanding shifts, and you physically experience it — the walls are closer, the ceiling is lower, the air is different. That’s not metaphor. That’s phenomenology.”</p>
<p>“That’s melodrama.”</p>
<p>“It’s the same thing, in the right hands.”</p>
<p>Enríquez almost laughed. Almost. “Fine. Let your archivist feel the room change. But give her the intelligence not to trust the feeling. Give her the sense that when reality seems to rearrange itself around you, it’s not magic — it’s trauma. It’s the thing your mother never told you finally arriving, and your nervous system responding before your mind does.”</p>
<p>I asked about the books themselves — the ones hidden in the house. What were they? Whose were they?</p>
<p>“Books from the libraries of the disappeared,” Enríquez said immediately. “Someone brought them to the grandmother to hide. That happened — it’s documented. People hid books, papers, records, photographs. They hid them in attics, in basements, in the walls of houses. They hid them in other books — slipped pages between the leaves of encyclopedias, tucked letters into the bindings. The books were evidence that someone had existed, and hiding them was an act of resistance.”</p>
<p>“And the books should be alive,” Zafón said. “I don’t mean metaphorically. I mean the protagonist should have the experience — and we leave it ambiguous whether this is real or imagined — that the books are doing something. That the text changes. That the names in the margins migrate. That the narrative inside the book knows she’s reading it.”</p>
<p>“No.”</p>
<p>“No?”</p>
<p>“No.” Enríquez set her coffee cup down hard enough that the one-eyed cat opened its eye. “The minute you introduce magic, you give the reader permission to file the whole thing under fantasy. ‘Oh, the books are enchanted, how charming.’ No. The horror of the dictatorship is that it was real. Every disappeared person was real. Every burned book was real. If you make the books supernatural, you make the disappearance metaphorical, and it was not metaphorical. Thirty thousand people.”</p>
<p>There was a long silence. The shopkeeper turned a page of her crossword. A motorcycle passed on the street outside, its engine sound ricocheting off the old facades.</p>
<p>“What if it’s ambiguous?” I said quietly.</p>
<p>Both of them looked at me.</p>
<p>“What if the text appears to change, but we never confirm it? The protagonist photographs the pages. Later, the photographs don’t match the physical text. But — she could be misremembering. She could be projecting. She’s been reading her dead grandmother’s diary in an empty library at night. She’s just learned that her family was involved in something she can’t talk about. Her nervous system is shattered. So when the text of a novel seems to describe the room she’s sitting in, to name her by name — is the book alive, or is she breaking?”</p>
<p>Enríquez was watching me carefully. “That could work,” she said. “If you never tip the hand. If the reader finishes the story genuinely not knowing whether the supernatural element is real. Not as a gimmick — not a ‘was it a dream?’ ending — but because the story has earned the ambiguity by showing how trauma makes the world unreliable.”</p>
<p>“And the books carry the names,” Zafón said softly. “That’s the part I care about. Whether the books are alive or not, they carry the names of the disappeared. Written into the margins, the endpapers, the spaces between lines. The grandmother wrote the names into every book, so that if any single volume survived, it carried the evidence. A library is a census. Burn the library and you burn the census. But this woman made every book into a census, so they’d all have to burn every book in the world to erase those names.”</p>
<p>“That’s the thing I want the reader to feel,” he continued. “Not that the books are magic. That a human woman, facing the possibility that everything she loved was about to be destroyed, sat down with a pencil and wrote the names of the dead into the margins of books, one by one, for months. That’s not supernatural. That’s the most human act I can imagine.”</p>
<p>Enríquez said nothing for a while. She was looking at the shelves. I wondered what she was seeing — whether she was thinking about the actual hidden libraries, the ones that were found in the walls of houses in the eighties and nineties when buildings were demolished, the books that emerged blinking into a country that had pretended they never existed.</p>
<p>“The house should be gone,” she said finally. “When the granddaughter goes to find it, it should be something horrible and ordinary. A parking garage. A three-level parking structure built on top of the ashes. Cars going in and out all day over the place where her grandmother died.”</p>
<p>“Yes,” I said. “Yes, that’s —”</p>
<p>“And something growing through the concrete. Not a metaphor. An actual plant. A weed, or a tree seedling. Something that shouldn’t be alive in a parking garage but is.”</p>
<p>Zafón nodded slowly. “A jacaranda.”</p>
<p>“Why a jacaranda?”</p>
<p>“Because the house had one. In the courtyard. The grandmother wrote about it.”</p>
<p>“Too neat,” Enríquez said.</p>
<p>“Life is sometimes too neat. That’s the part that scares us.”</p>
<p>We sat with that. The shopkeeper closed her crossword book and began turning off the lights in the back of the store, one row of shelves at a time, and the shadows advanced toward us like a tide. None of us moved to leave. The cat opened its eye again, looked at each of us in turn, and went back to sleep.</p>
<p>“The ending,” I said. “I don’t know how it ends.”</p>
<p>“It doesn’t end,” Enríquez said. “That’s the whole point. The dictatorship ended but the disappearances didn’t end. The names are still missing from the registries. The bodies are still in the river. You give this story an ending and you’ve lied to every family that’s still looking.”</p>
<p>“But the reader needs —”</p>
<p>“The reader needs to sit with the discomfort of something unfinished. That’s the function of postcolonial gothic. It’s not a haunted house you can leave. It’s the house you live in.”</p>
<p>Zafón picked up one of the books from the shelf beside him, a slim paperback with a broken spine, and opened it to a random page. He read silently for a moment, then set it down.</p>
<p>“The last line should be the protagonist opening a book,” he said. “Starting to read. Not an ending. A continuation.”</p>
<p>Enríquez started to argue, then stopped. She looked at the book Zafón had set down. A small crease appeared between her eyebrows — the expression of someone encountering an idea she hadn’t expected to tolerate.</p>
<p>“If it’s not an ending,” she said. “If it’s genuinely not an ending. If the reader understands that when she opens the book, it’s not resolution. It’s work. It’s the ongoing, unfinishable work of reading the names.”</p>
<p>“Yes,” Zafón said. “The catalogue continues.”</p>
<p>The shopkeeper turned off the last row of lights. We were sitting in the glow from the street, the window behind us casting long yellow rectangles across the floor. Somewhere outside, a bus hissed to a stop and hissed again and moved on.</p>
<p>I closed my notebook. I hadn’t written anything in the last twenty minutes. I’d been listening, and something had formed — not a plot, not an outline, but a pressure behind the sternum, the sense of a story that already existed and was waiting for me to find it, the way the archivist would find the diary, the way the names would surface from the margins of books that had survived the burning. Whether that pressure was the story coming alive or my own projection, I couldn’t say. The ambiguity, I was starting to understand, was the point.</p> </section> <div class="meeting-footer" data-astro-cid-uzeevf5o> <div class="meeting-footer__nav" data-astro-cid-uzeevf5o> <a href="/read/the-catalogue-of-burned-things/" class="meeting-footer__link meeting-footer__link--primary" data-astro-cid-uzeevf5o>
