Wooden chairs, marble tables veined with grey, an espresso machine from the last century that the owner refused to replace on grounds I never learned. Camus was already seated when I arrived. He had coffee and a half-smoked cigarette and the particular stillness of a man who is comfortable being looked at. Calvino came in seven minutes late, carrying a book he set face-down on the table so that neither of us could read the title. I did not ask about it. He did not explain.</p>
<p>I had notes. I always have notes. They were in a small leather notebook that I carried because I once read that serious writers carry notebooks, and I wanted to be taken seriously, and the wanting embarrassed me, and the embarrassment was itself a kind of seriousness, and so the notebook survived.</p>
<p>“The premise,” I said. “A man is brought before a committee because he has never finished a book. He borrows them, reads partway through, returns them. Two hundred and fourteen books over eleven years. The committee treats this as a moral failing.”</p>
<p>“Good,” Camus said. He said it without emphasis. The word landed flat on the table like a coin.</p>
<p>Calvino tilted his head. “A committee. Not a court?”</p>
<p>“A committee. More ambiguous. Less legal, more — ”</p>
<p>“More institutional. Yes. The bureaucratic machine that does not know it is a machine.” He picked up Camus’s coffee, realized it was not his, set it down. “A court has dignity. A committee has clipboards. A man facing a clipboard is funnier and sadder than a man facing a judge.”</p>
<p>“It is not funny,” Camus said.</p>
<p>“Everything with a clipboard is a little funny.”</p>
<p>“Then you and I are working on different stories.”</p>
<p>This was the first disagreement, and it arrived early, and I wrote nothing in my notebook because the disagreement was the note.</p>
<p>Camus leaned forward. His forearms rested on the table. “The man’s crime is that he will not pretend. The books are not the issue. The committee is not the issue. The issue is that everyone around him agrees to a fiction — that finishing a book is a civic act, that narrative investment is moral participation — and he does not agree, and his refusal is intolerable because it makes the fiction visible.”</p>
<p>“Like Meursault,” I said, and immediately wished I had not, because one does not explain a man to himself.</p>
<p>But Camus only shrugged. “Like anyone who stops performing the agreed-upon emotion at the agreed-upon moment. Meursault at the funeral. This man at the library. The content of the transgression changes. The shape does not.”</p>
<p>“But you are describing a tragedy,” Calvino said. He had ordered his own coffee now, and was stirring it with a spoon even though he had added nothing to it. The stirring was a fidget, a form of thinking with the hand. “A man is judged for his honesty. Society punishes the authentic self. This is powerful, Albert, and it is also a story I have read — forgive me — many times.”</p>
<p>“Many good stories have been read many times.”</p>
<p>“Many good stories have also calcified into shapes. The shape of this one is: sincere man, unjust tribunal, moral clarity achieved through suffering.” He stopped stirring. “I want to break the shape.”</p>
<p>“I did not say he suffers.”</p>
<p>“You implied he achieves clarity.”</p>
<p>“Clarity is not the same as suffering.”</p>
<p>“In your work it often is.”</p>
<p>Camus exhaled smoke. It curled above us and dissipated against the ceiling, which was yellowed from decades of exactly this kind of exhalation in exactly this kind of café. I watched the smoke because I did not want to look at either of them.</p>
<p>“What do you propose?” Camus said. Not conceding. Asking.</p>
<p>Calvino set his hands flat on the table, palms down, as though preparing to play a piano that was not there. “The story restarts. Multiple times. Each beginning is told by a different voice — the committee, the man himself, the secretary who takes the minutes, the reader. The narrative never completes because the story is about incompletion. The form mirrors the content.”</p>
<p>“Ah,” Camus said. “The game.”</p>
<p>“It is not a game.”</p>
<p>“It is always a game with you, Italo. A beautiful game. The reader turns the page expecting the next page and finds instead a different book. I have admired this. But I want to know: inside the game, is there a man? When the narrative restarts for the third time, does the man in the chair still have a body? Does his back ache from the wooden seat? Does he smell the sea through the window?”</p>
<p>This landed. I could see it land. Calvino’s fingers curled slightly against the marble.</p>
<p>“Yes,” he said, quieter. “The man has a body.”</p>
<p>“Then we agree on something.”</p>
<p>“We agree on the body. We disagree on what to do with it.”</p>
<p>I opened my notebook. I wrote: <em>the body persists across the restarts</em>. This seemed important. The narrative frames could collapse and reconstitute, but the man — his posture, his coffee, the light on his hands — would remain constant. A fixed point in a shifting structure.</p>
<p>“I want to talk about reading,” I said. “The act itself. The man stops reading because he becomes aware that he is reading. He feels the page under his fingers. He notices the room. The immersion breaks.”</p>
<p>Camus nodded. “That is the moment. The moment when the agreed-upon fiction — the pact between reader and text — dissolves. He surfaces.”</p>
<p>“Surfaces,” Calvino repeated. “You keep using spatial metaphors. Reading is submersion, living is surface. Down and up.”</p>
<p>“Because that is how it feels.”</p>
<p>“To you. To me, reading is lateral. You do not go down into a book. You go sideways. You step from one room into an adjacent room. The book is next to your life, not below it. And the moment of awareness your man experiences — when he feels the page — is not a surfacing. It is a door opening between rooms, and he sees both rooms at once, and he cannot choose.”</p>
<p>I wrote this down. The metaphor mattered. If reading is vertical — submersion and surfacing — then Dahl’s return to his own life is a kind of gasping, an involuntary coming-up-for-air. If reading is lateral — adjacent rooms — then his awareness is a doubled vision, seeing two realities simultaneously, and the anguish is not the return but the split.</p>
<p>“Both,” I said. “Can it be both? The prose voice is vertical — Dahl experiences surfacing, the sharp return. But the structure is lateral — the multiple beginnings are rooms side by side, and the reader moves between them.”</p>
<p>Camus looked at Calvino. Calvino looked at his coffee. There was a silence that was not agreement and not disagreement but something more like two men discovering they have been building the same house from opposite ends.</p>
<p>“The committee,” Camus said after a while. “They need to be specific. Real people with real habits. The woman with reading glasses she does not use. The man who clicks his pen.”</p>
<p>“Yes. Physical. Not allegorical.”</p>
<p>“And the man — Dahl — does not defend himself eloquently. He is not a philosopher. He is a man who notices things. The steam above his coffee. The fly on the window. His philosophical insight is accidental. He arrives at it the way you arrive at the bottom of a hill: by walking, not by thinking about walking.”</p>
<p>“Dahl,” Calvino said. “Why Dahl?”</p>
<p>“It is short. It is nothing. A sound more than a name.”</p>
<p>“Names are frames,” Calvino said. “I want the name to shift. In one telling he is Dahl. In another, just ‘the man.’ In the voice of the secretary he might not have a name at all — just ‘the defendant.’ The instability of the name is the instability of narrative authority.”</p>
<p>“That is a device,” Camus said.</p>
<p>“Yes.”</p>
<p>“Devices can be transparent.”</p>
<p>“Transparency is not a flaw. A window is transparent. You still see the garden through it.”</p>
<p>Camus tapped his cigarette against the ashtray. The ash fell cleanly. “There is a risk,” he said, “that the cleverness of the structure will substitute for the feeling. The reader admires the architecture and forgets the man in the chair. I have seen this happen. I have seen readers close a book and say ‘how inventive’ when they should have said ‘how lonely.’”</p>
<p>“And I have seen readers close a book and say ‘how sad’ when they should have asked ‘what just happened to me,’” Calvino said. “Feeling without structure is sentiment. Structure without feeling is exercise. We are trying to do both.”</p>
<p>“We are trying. Yes.”</p>
<p>This was, I understood, as close to agreement as they would come, and it was not close. It was two men standing on the same piece of ground and looking in different directions and calling what they saw by the same name.</p>
<p>“The secretary,” I said, because I wanted to steer us somewhere concrete before the abstraction swallowed everything. “There is a character — the woman who types the minutes. She records the hearing. She has been doing this job for years. She is not indifferent, but she is practiced. And something about Dahl’s testimony gets through the practice.”</p>
<p>“What gets through?” Camus asked.</p>
<p>“His phrase. The specific moment. He says something about the book and him being in the same room but no longer in the same country. She types it and her hands stop.”</p>
<p>Calvino sat up straighter. “Yes. The bureaucrat who is accidentally moved. She types the words and the words reach her and for a moment she is doing what Dahl cannot — she is inside the text and inside her life at the same time. She does not notice this. She would not call it that. But her hands pause, and the pause is the whole story.”</p>
<p>“The pause is not the whole story,” Camus said, but he said it the way you contradict someone when you know they are mostly right and you need to preserve one small territory of disagreement to feel like yourself. “The whole story is the man in the hallway afterward, sitting on the bench, watching a fly on the glass. The hearing is over and nothing has been resolved and he is still the man who does not finish books, and the fly cleans its legs, and the light comes through the window, and he watches without interpreting, and that watching — that plain, stupid, physical attention to a fly on a piece of glass — is the only honest act in the building.”</p>
<p>“You want the story to end there?”</p>
<p>“I want the story to end in a kitchen. Morning light. A book closed on the table. The harbor outside. He is not reading. He is not performing presence. He simply is, for a few seconds, alive in the way that narratives cannot accommodate.”</p>
<p>“That is an ending,” Calvino said.</p>
<p>“That is a morning.”</p>
<p>“Mornings are endings. Everything after waking is a form of ending.”</p>
<p>Camus smiled. It was small and did not reach his eyes and was perhaps the most genuine expression I had seen on his face. “Now you sound like me.”</p>
<p>“God forbid.”</p>
<p>I closed my notebook. I had written almost nothing in it. The conversation had outrun my ability to annotate, which was, I suspected, the point. You do not capture a meeting between these two minds. You survive it. You carry away fragments — the body persists, the rooms are lateral, the fly on the glass, the seconds that do not belong to any narrative — and you hope that when you sit down to write, the fragments assemble into something that neither of them would have made alone.</p>
<p>“One more thing,” Calvino said. He reached for the book he had brought, the one face-down on the table, and turned it over. It was a library copy of a novel I did not recognize, in Italian, with a cracked spine and a coffee ring on the cover.</p>
<p>“I never finished it,” he said. “I have been carrying it for thirty years.”</p>
<p>He placed it between us on the table. A fact. Not a symbol.</p>
<p>Camus looked at the book. He did not pick it up. “What stopped you?”</p>
<p>“Page one hundred and nineteen. The protagonist walks into a garden and the description of the garden is so precise — the specific flowers, the specific light, the specific sound of water from a stone fountain — that I put the book down and went outside. I walked to a park. I sat on a bench. I stayed there for an hour. When I came home, the book was still open on my desk, and I could not go back to the garden in the text because I had been in a real garden, and the real garden had won.”</p>
<p>“The real garden won,” Camus repeated.</p>
<p>“The real garden always wins. That is the secret that reading keeps from us. The text is extraordinary, and the world is ordinary, and the ordinary wins because it is actual, and actuality is the only thing that does not need your belief in order to exist.”</p>
<p>Camus picked up his coffee. It had gone cold. He drank it anyway — the whole cup, in one tilt — and set it down, and the sound of the cup on the saucer was precise and small and carried no meaning at all, which is perhaps why I remember it.</p>
<p>“I want to address the reader,” Calvino said. “Directly. At some point, the text turns and speaks to the person holding it. ‘You are reading this. You have not stopped.’ The moment should be unsettling.”</p>
<p>“It will be unsettling if it is specific,” Camus said. “Do not ask the reader a philosophical question. Ask them whether they noticed the moment when the words stopped being words. Ask them about the space between two sentences where their attention flickered.”</p>
<p>“You would write this passage?”</p>
<p>“I would not write it. But you should. And when you do, make it physical. Not ‘did you lose yourself in the narrative’ but ‘did you forget the weight of the device in your hand, did you forget the temperature of the room, and if so, what brought you back.’”</p>
<p>I realized then that Camus was not rejecting Calvino’s metafiction. He was colonizing it. Taking the self-aware, frame-breaking move and insisting that it smell like coffee and feel like a wooden chair. Calvino saw this too — I could see him seeing it — and his expression was the expression of a man who has been outflanked in a way he almost admires.</p>
<p>I left the café first. They stayed, and I imagine they ordered more coffee, and I imagine the conversation continued without me, and I imagine it did not reach a conclusion, because conclusions are for books, and this was a morning in a city where the light falls on marble tables without asking permission, and the espresso machine hisses, and two men who have spent their lives making fictions sit across from each other and talk about the one thing fiction cannot hold — the actual, physical, unrepeatable fact of being in a room, in a body, on a morning that will not come again.</p>
<p>Through the window I could see a woman walking a dog past a boulangerie, and the dog was pulling toward a smell in the gutter, and the woman was pulling toward wherever she was going, and between them the leash was taut like a sentence stretched between two meanings that refuse to resolve.</p>
<p>I did not open my notebook again. What I needed was not in the notes.</p> </section> <div class="meeting-footer" data-astro-cid-uzeevf5o> <div class="meeting-footer__nav" data-astro-cid-uzeevf5o> <a href="/read/beginning-a-book-you-will-not-finish/" class="meeting-footer__link meeting-footer__link--primary" data-astro-cid-uzeevf5o>
