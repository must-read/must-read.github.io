## Writing Samples

### Sample 1: Stephen King — 'Salem's Lot (Author A + Work X)
**Source**: 'Salem's Lot, various chapters — town descriptions, interlude passages, and the Marsten House
**Why representative**: Shows King's method of rendering a town as a living organism through brand-name specificity, conversational philosophical register, and the accumulation of mundane domestic detail that makes the supernatural violation feel real.

Town-as-organism passages:

> "At three in the morning the blood runs slow and thick, and slumber is heavy. The soul either sleeps in blessed ignorance of such an hour or gazes about itself in utter despair. There is no middle ground. At three in the morning the gaudy paint is off that old whore, the world, and she has no nose and a glass eye."

> "The town knew about darkness. It knew about the darkness that comes on the land when rotation hides the land from the sun, and about the darkness of the human soul."

> "The town cares for devil's work no more than it cares for God's or man's. It knew darkness. And darkness was enough."

> "The town kept its secrets, and the Marsten House brooded over it like a ruined king."

> "Small towns have long memories and pass their horrors down ceremonially from generation to generation."

> "In the Lot the dark held hard."

> "In the east the stars are already out. They gleam steadily, like fierce diamonds. There is no mercy in them at this time of the year."

The outsider returns — the Marsten House:

> "It was just the same. There was no difference, not at all. He might have last seen it yesterday. The witch grass grew wild and tall in the front yard, obscuring the old, frost-heaved flagstones that led to the porch. Chirring crickets sang in it, and he could see grasshoppers jumping in erratic parabolas. The house itself looked toward town. It was huge and rambling and sagging, its windows haphazardly boarded shut, giving the house that sinister look of all old houses that have been empty for a long time. The paint had been weathered away, giving the house a uniform gray look."

Domestic texture and interior monologue:

> "The sandwich he made was bologna and cheese, his favorite."

> "Crying was like pissing everything out on the ground."

> "The basis of all human fears, he thought. A closed door, slightly ajar."

> "If a fear cannot be articulated, it can't be conquered."

> "Being in the town is a daily act of utter intercourse, so complete that it makes what you and your wife do in the squeaky bed look like a handshake."

The key structural principle: corruption spreads house by house, family member infects family member, and the community collapses from within. Once enough of the town turns, the rules change — there is no sanctified threshold left to keep evil out. The outsider (Ben Mears) returns and sees what the locals cannot name. King's method is environmental immersion — "create any kind of environment that the reader can identify with totally" and then "inject it with the fantasy element." The monster belongs not "in a graveyard in decadent old Europe, but in the house down the street."

### Sample 2: M.R. James — "A Warning to the Curious" (Author B + Work Y)
**Source**: "A Warning to the Curious" (1925), key passages throughout the story
**Why representative**: The story this plan most directly draws from. Shows James's signature moves: the antiquarian narrator, the scholarly discovery that opens a door that swings one way, the guardian who persists beyond death, and the devastating final image.

Opening — the landscape as character:

> "The place on the east coast which the reader is asked to consider is Seaburgh. It is not very different now from what I remember it to have been when I was a child. Marshes intersected by dykes to the south, recalling the early chapters of Great Expectations; flat fields to the north, merging into heath..."

The supernatural stalker — the figure that is never in front:

> "It began when I was first prospecting, and put me off again and again. There was always somebody — a man — standing by one of the firs. This was in daylight, you know. He was never in front of me."

The excavation — the cry behind:

> "It was like someone scraping at my back all the time... And when I actually laid it bare and got my fingers into the ring of it and pulled it out, there came a sort of cry behind me — oh, I can't tell you how desolate it was!"

The guardian — the watcher who "has some power over your eyes":

The figure can be seen or not seen as it pleases. It moves belongings, makes whisperings and scratchings. The last of the Harker family — William Ager — died at 28, but persists as a presence that watches the burial site. During times of war, members of the Ager family spent every night camping out at the site. The guardian duty persists beyond death.

The final discovery on the beach:

> "Paxton was there at the bottom... His tracks showed that he had run along the side of the battery, had turned sharp round the corner of it, and, small doubt of it, must have dashed straight into the open arms of someone who was waiting there."

> "His mouth was full of sand and stones, and his teeth and jaws were broken to bits."

The legend of the three crowns: Anglo-Saxon crowns buried along the coast to protect against invasion. Two have been lost to the sea. One remains. The Ager family are its sworn guardians. Paxton, an amateur archaeologist, digs it up out of scholarly curiosity. He tries to return it. It does not matter. The guardian takes him anyway.

### Sample 3: M.R. James — "'Oh, Whistle, and I'll Come to You, My Lad'" (Author B)
**Source**: "'Oh, Whistle, and I'll Come to You, My Lad'" (1904)
**Why representative**: James's masterwork of restraint and suggestion — the rational scholar undone by the thing he disturbed, the horror that works through indirection rather than gore.

The whistle inscription: "QUIS EST ISTE QUI VENIT" — "Who is this who is coming?"

The apparition pursuing a figure across the beach: something in "pale, fluttering draperies" — seen at a distance, gaining on the terrified man ahead of it. Seen, but not clearly.

The climactic manifestation: "A horrible, an intensely horrible, face of crumbled linen."

Parkins is "young, neat, and precise in speech" — a rationalist who dismisses the supernatural. The horror works precisely because it undoes a mind that believed itself immune. The scholarly detachment that defines the protagonist becomes the vulnerability that destroys him. His framework of understanding shatters completely.

James's structural method: the protagonist is always a scholar or antiquarian. The horror enters through research — through reading the wrong document, opening the wrong tomb, blowing the wrong whistle. The act of investigation is the transgression. Curiosity itself is the sin.

### Sample 4: Stephen King — Prose Technique and Style (Author A)
**Source**: Various King novels and critical analysis
**Why representative**: Documents King's method of grounding horror in domestic mundanity — the conversational interior monologue, the brand-name texture, the ordinary-rendered-terrifying.

From *It*:

> "The terror, which would not end for another twenty-eight years — if it ever did end — began, so far as I know or can tell, with a boat made from a sheet of newspapers floating down a gutter swollen with rain."

The signature King moves visible here: the conversational aside ("so far as I know or can tell"), the self-correcting hedge ("if it ever did end"), the specific domestic image (the newspaper boat in the gutter). Horror emerges from the texture of ordinary life — chipped mugs, worn sneakers, bologna sandwiches.

King's self-description: "The literary equivalent of a Big Mac and a large fries from McDonald's." The goal is total environmental immersion. Brand names and pop-culture references build familiarity. The reader feels at home. Then the floor drops out.

Critical analysis of King's blue-collar voice: "He describes the ordinary — a chipped paint mug, the worn-out sneakers of a child — with the same meticulous detail he uses for the supernatural." The voice is conversational, rambling, clause-heavy, self-correcting — "this is how people talk in real life." His fictions open in "suburban or small-town America — Derry, Maine, or Libertyville, Pennsylvania — and have the familiarity of the house next door and the 7-Eleven store."

In 'Salem's Lot specifically: the vampire represents social decay. Neighbor infects neighbor. The community collapses from within. King drew on Matheson's *I Am Legend* and Finney's *The Body Snatchers*, focusing on "fragmentation" as a contemporary concern — Watergate-era disillusionment turned into horror.

## Writing Samples

A retired county librarian returns to the dying Maine coast town where she grew up, tasked with cataloguing the papers of a recently deceased local historian. Among his documents she finds a seventeenth-century survey map — and evidence that something was buried along the eroding bluffs to hold something back. When she visits the site, she finds not the object but the hole where it was. Someone already removed it. And now, house by house, the town is going quiet. Lights off earlier each night. Neighbors not answering doors. A figure at the tree line that is never in front of her, never quite there when she turns. Something that has been keeping watch for three hundred years and wants what was taken put back in the ground.

### Sample 2: Author B — Tana French (Style)

**Nell Britten**, 62. Recently retired head librarian of Sargasso County, Maine. Widowed three years ago. She returned to Harrowfield because the historical society asked her to process the papers of Aldous Fane, who died alone in his house on Chandler Street. She grew up in Harrowfield, left at eighteen, and has not been back in forty-four years.

- **What she WANTS**: To do the cataloguing job competently, settle her parents' old house (which she inherited and never visited), and leave. Clean. Transactional. Done.
- **What she NEEDS**: To reckon with why she left. When she was nine, she saw something standing among the pines behind the bluffs — a figure that should not have been there. She told herself it was a hunter. She has spent forty-four years maintaining that fiction. She needs to stop filing the unknown under "explained" and recognize that some things resist classification.
- **Her flaw**: Nell is a cataloguer. She believes the unknown is merely the not-yet-organized — that if she labels, shelves, and cross-references correctly, she can master anything. This intellectual confidence makes her the ideal Jamesian protagonist: the scholar whose competence is the door through which the horror enters. She treats Fane's papers as a professional puzzle. She does not grasp, until too late, that solving the puzzle is the transgression.

### Sample 3: Work X — Murder on the Orient Express (Structure)

**Opening scene**: Nell arriving in Harrowfield on a gray October afternoon, driving past boarded storefronts and the Dollar General that replaced the old five-and-dime. The town is quieter than she remembers — not peaceful quiet, but held-breath quiet. She pulls up to Fane's house on Chandler Street. The front door is unlocked. The lights are on. Fane's reading glasses sit on his desk as though he stepped out for coffee. He died three weeks ago. The lights should not be on.

**Inciting disruption**: Among Fane's papers, Nell finds a 1683 survey of the Harrowfield coast, annotated in a later hand. Someone — Fane — has circled a site on the bluffs and written in shaky handwriting: *Removed Aug. 14. God forgive me.* Beside the map, a family genealogy for a name she recognizes from the old cemetery: Harker. The last Harker died in 1971. Nell was nine that year. That was the year she saw the figure in the pines.

**Escalating middle**: Nell visits the bluff site and finds a careful excavation, weeks old, done with archaeologist's tools. The hole is empty. She begins asking around town about Fane's last weeks. The postmaster — chatty at first — shuts down when she mentions the Harker genealogy. "Some things go back further than anyone needs to know about." Fane "got funny" this summer. Stopped coming to the diner. Started keeping his curtains drawn. Since then, others have gone quiet too. Mrs. Pedersen on Maple doesn't answer her door. The Gagnon boy hasn't been to school. The store closes at three now — used to stay open till seven.

At night, Nell hears footsteps circling Fane's house — dead leaves, rhythmic, never matching to a shape when she looks. The figure is always behind her. She glimpses it in reflections: in the dark window glass over the sink, in the side mirror of her Subaru. Thin. Patient. It has been waiting a very long time.

**Crisis point**: Nell discovers what Fane took — a lead-sealed casket containing a covenant object, something placed in the earth three centuries ago by the Harker family to bind or contain a specific evil. Fane thought it was an archaeological curiosity. He broke the seal and brought it home. The thing the casket held back is loose now. It has been moving through town at night, house by house. The people it visits do not come out the same. The figure Nell keeps seeing — the last Harker, dead fifty-three years — is a guardian that cannot act, only watch. Its presence is the warning: return what was taken, or Harrowfield will be emptied.

**Ending**: Nell finds the casket in Fane's basement, hidden behind a panel. She drives to the bluff at night with a shovel and a flashlight, the casket in a Hannaford grocery bag. She can hear the ocean below. She can hear footsteps in the dead grass behind her — a half-beat off from her own rhythm. She does not look back. She digs. She places the casket in the earth and fills the hole. The ground takes it — not like filling a hole, but like something closing. She stands. The figure is there, among three dead pines, visible for the first and only time: a man in outdated clothes, expressionless, looking not at her but past her, toward the town. Then it is gone. She drives out of Harrowfield at dawn. In the rearview mirror, the town looks the same. But she will not go back. And she knows — without evidence, without anything she could catalogue or shelve — that she did not act soon enough. The houses she passed on the way out were dark. All of them. And the school parking lot was empty on a Wednesday morning.

### Sample 4: Work Y — In the Woods (Themes)

1. **The catalogue room** — Nell sorting Fane's papers at his desk, the quiet pleasure of organizing a dead man's intellectual life, interrupted by the 1683 map. She holds it to the desk lamp. She reads the annotation. The handwriting is shaky — not Fane's usual precise script. She notices his reading glasses are broken: one lens shattered, as if he crushed them in his hand. *(Advances plot: establishes the mystery. Reveals character: Nell's need to organize, her observational precision, her instinct to treat horror as data.)*

2. **The postmaster scene** — Nell at the post office/general store. Fluorescent lights humming. A Slim Jim display. A faded Celtics schedule taped to the register. The postmaster is chatty at first, goes quiet when she mentions Fane's Harker research. She notices his hands shaking. She notices the store closes at 3 PM now. She catalogues these facts. She does not take them as warning. *(King's domestic texture married to rising dread. Shows the town dying cell by cell — the 'Salem's Lot structural engine.)*

3. **The reflection** — Nell washing dishes at Fane's kitchen sink at dusk. She glances at the window glass and sees, reflected, a figure standing approximately fifteen feet behind her in the yard. Thin. Still. Facing the house. She turns. Nothing. She looks at the window again. Nothing either. But the motion-sensor light on the back porch — the one she tested that morning — does not come on for the rest of the night, as though something is standing perfectly still within its range. *(Pure James: peripheral vision, the wrong thing in the wrong place, suggestion over description. The reader fills in what Nell cannot bring herself to see.)*

4. **The basement** — Nell finds the hidden panel behind Fane's old workbench, the lead casket inside. A bundle wrapped in oilskin. Corroded metal. A folded document in a hand so old the ink has turned brown. She reads enough to understand: the Harker family placed this here in covenant with something, to keep it sealed. Fane removed it because he mistook it for treasure. The casket smells wrong — not decay, but absence, like the air in a room sealed for centuries. She gags. She wraps it in a garbage bag from the roll under Fane's sink. *(King's domestic detail — the garbage bag, the oilskin, the mundane containing the terrible — fused with the Jamesian revelation-through-documents.)*

5. **The reburial** — Night, the bluff, a shovel, a flashlight, the casket in a Hannaford bag. Footsteps in dead grass behind her, a half-beat off her rhythm. She does not look back. She digs. She places the casket. She fills the hole. The ground seems to accept it. She stands and sees the Harker figure for the first and only time: among three dead pines, in clothes from another century, face not hostile but extinguished — like a lantern blown out. Looking past her, toward the town. Then gone. *(The Jamesian final image: not gore but a vision that lingers. The figure that has watched for three hundred years, finally visible, finally done — but too late.)*

## 5. Emotional Trajectory

The reader begins with **melancholy familiarity** — the sadness of a dying small town, the bittersweet ache of returning to a place that has shrunk and faded. This is comfortable territory. We know this feeling.

It shifts to **professional curiosity** as Nell begins cataloguing. The reader shares her intellectual pleasure in the documentary puzzle — old maps, genealogies, the satisfaction of making order from someone else's mess.

**Unease** creeps in as the town's wrongness becomes legible. Shops closing early. Neighbors unreachable. The postmaster's shaking hands. The held-breath quality of a community that has pulled its blinds shut.

The middle section delivers **escalating dread** — the figure that is never in front, the reflection that cannot be there, the motion-sensor light that stays dark. The reader understands that something has been loosed and is working through Harrowfield methodically, and that Nell's compulsion to classify and catalogue is keeping her from acting.

The climax brings **urgency and isolation** — Nell alone on a bluff at night, burying something she does not fully understand, hearing footsteps that are not hers, not looking back.

The ending lands on **cold, residual horror**. She did the right thing. But too late. The final image is not the ghost — it is the empty school parking lot. The dark houses. The reader is left not with a scream but with the slow, sick realization that Harrowfield is already gone. The town died while Nell was sorting papers.

### 3. Structure

**Author A (Stephen King)** — Most concentrated in: **the postmaster scene and Nell's interior monologue throughout.** The narrative voice should feel like eavesdropping on someone's thoughts — Nell's internal register is blue-collar New England despite her professional education, studded with brand names (Hannaford, Dollar General, Slim Jims, Dunkin' Donuts, Subaru) and pop-culture shorthand. The town must feel like a real Maine coast town with a real failing economy and real people who shop at specific stores and watch specific channels. King's method: make the ordinary granular so the extraordinary has real ground to shatter.

**Author B (M.R. James)** — Most concentrated in: **the reflection scene and the reburial.** James's technique is peripheral horror — the thing seen in window glass, the footsteps a half-beat off, the figure never in front. At the moments of greatest horror, the prose should adopt James's restraint: do NOT describe the guardian in detail. Do not explain the covenant fully. Do not specify what the casket held back. Let the reader's imagination work. The final image of the figure among the pines — expressionless, looking past Nell, then gone — should land the way Paxton's mouth full of sand does: an image that refuses to leave.

**Work X ('Salem's Lot)** — Most concentrated in: **the structural decay of the town.** The corruption spreading house by house IS the 'Salem's Lot architecture transplanted to a different register. Mrs. Pedersen not answering her door. The Gagnon boy absent from school. The postmaster's hands shaking. The store closing at three. Nell is the outsider who returns and sees what the remaining locals cannot or will not name. The "evacuation of normalcy" manifests as an accumulation of small absences — not dramatic events but things that are no longer happening. The town dying not with a scream but with a series of lights going out.

**Work Y (A Warning to the Curious)** — Most concentrated in: **the entire plot engine.** The sacred object that must not be disturbed (the covenant casket). The guardian who persists beyond death (the last Harker). The cost of knowledge (Fane's death, the town's slow emptying). The landscape that watches (the bluffs, the dead pines, the eroding coast). Nell's antiquarian research — sorting documents, following a paper trail — opens a door that swings only one way. The three-crown legend maps directly onto the covenant concept. The Ager family guardianship maps onto the Harker family. Paxton's fatal curiosity maps onto Fane's, with Nell as the secondary witness who arrives too late.

**Ending**: Nora pieces together that Sylvie died of natural causes — a heart attack, brought on by the shock of reading confirmation of what happened to her daughter in Philippa's journal. The "murder" dissolves into something more devastating: a death caused by truth arriving too late. But the torn page is still missing, and one of the guests took it — someone protecting a living person connected to the events of 1981. Nora must decide whether to find the page or let one more secret stay buried. She chooses to find it. She is done with silence. But the story ends before she reads what is on it. The house settles. The storm continues. One thread stays open.

**Custody of the Sealed Ground**

Evokes the guardian-covenant theme (custody = guardianship, sealed ground = the buried object and the land it protects) without starting with "The." It carries a legalistic, archival quality that mirrors Nell's librarian worldview and the antiquarian research thread from James. It implies obligation, containment, and the question of what happens when custody is abandoned.

## Notes for Writer Agent

- **Length discipline**: 2,800 words target. This is SHORT. No meandering descriptions, no extended backstory dumps. The five key scenes above are the skeleton — flesh them economically. Every sentence earns its place or gets cut.
- **Voice blend**: The narrative voice lives between King and James. Interior monologue in King's conversational register (Nell thinking in full colloquial sentences with asides and self-corrections), but the horror scenes shift toward James's restraint — shorter sentences, more precise diction, less interiority and more observed detail. The transition should be subtle, not signposted.
- **Do NOT over-explain**: The covenant, the guardian, the "infection" spreading through town — these remain partially opaque. The reader should understand enough to feel dread and not enough to feel safe. Leave the nature of what was sealed in the ground ambiguous. Leave the mechanism of the town's corruption unnamed.
- **The figure**: Never describe it fully. It is thin. It wears outdated clothes. Its face is expressionless — or extinguished, like a lantern blown out. That is all. The reader fills in the rest. It is NEVER in front of her. Always behind, always peripheral. This is pure James.
- **The town**: Name at least 5-6 specific locations, residents, or businesses to give Harrowfield King's textural density. Use Maine-specific details (Hannaford grocery bags, Marden's, Dollar General, Dunkin', L.L. Bean boots, Patriots references, Subaru Outback). The town must feel lived-in — a place with a real economy and real people — before it starts emptying.
- **Ending**: Resist the urge to resolve. Nell sealed the casket back in the ground. Good. But the town is already dark. The damage was done while she was being methodical. The last line should deliver a quiet, spreading chill — not a jump scare. The empty school parking lot on a Wednesday morning. That is the horror: not the ghost, but the absence it presided over.
- **Dread, not shock**: This story builds slowly and pays off with wrongness rather than violence. The scariest moment should be the motion-sensor light that stays dark — something so small and domestic it makes the skin crawl. The second scariest should be the empty town at dawn. No blood. No screaming. Just absence.
- **Banned names**: No "Marcus" or "Chen."
- **Prose AI-isms to avoid**: No "delve," "tapestry," "testament," "in the tapestry of," "a dance of," "it spoke to something deeper." No tidy epiphany. No announced theme. No symmetrical bookend. Nell does not learn a lesson. She survives. The town does not.
