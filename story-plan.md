---

## 2. Premise

A municipal sleep research clinic in a sprawling border city has been compiling somnographic intake reports on women who come in complaining of identical nightmares -- women who, one by one, stop returning for follow-up appointments and are later reported missing. The document we are reading is the clinic's internal case log: a sequential index of patient intake records, sleep study transcriptions, clinician annotations, and administrative notes that begins with bureaucratic precision and gradually reveals that the clinic itself -- its instruments, its architecture, its attending physician -- may be complicit in whatever is consuming these women. The question the story asks: *What happens when the system designed to document harm becomes the instrument of harm, and the only record of the dead is the paperwork that helped kill them?*

## 3. Protagonist

**Dr. Lourdes Araya**, 41, somnologist and clinic director at the Centro de Estudios del Sueno in a fictionalized border city (unnamed but recognizable as a Juarez/Santa Teresa analogue). Chilean by birth, she relocated after a fellowship at a Mexico City hospital eleven years ago and never left. Divorced. Lives alone in an apartment above a pharmacy.

- **What she WANTS**: To complete the clinic's annual case index — an internal document she compiles every December for the municipal health authority — and to explain, in clinical language, why seventeen of her patients failed to complete treatment. She wants the document to be clean. She wants the numbers to add up. She wants to believe the disappearances are coincidental.

- **What she NEEDS**: To admit that she has been using the clinical document as a shield — that the act of recording and categorizing these women's sleep disorders has become a way of not seeing what is happening to them. She needs to stop indexing and start *witnessing*.

- **Her flaw/blind spot**: Lourdes believes that rigorous documentation is a form of care. She has confused precision with compassion, the clinical record with the human record. She annotates, cross-references, and files while women vanish. Her training taught her that the body is legible if you have the right instruments. She cannot accept that some things happen beyond the reach of measurement — and that her instruments may be recording the *process* of these women's erasure rather than their illness.

- **The specific wound**: When Lourdes was nineteen, her younger sister Pilar went missing for eleven days in Santiago during a period of political unrest. Pilar was found alive — disoriented, dehydrated, with no memory of where she had been. The family never discussed it. Lourdes became a sleep researcher because Pilar, after her return, could not sleep without screaming, and Lourdes wanted to believe that if she could read the architecture of sleep, she could find where her sister had gone. Pilar died of an overdose at twenty-six. Lourdes still has Pilar's last polysomnogram printout folded in her desk drawer.

## 4. Structure

The document is the **Annual Case Index, Centro de Estudios del Sueno, Year 11** — a clinical log compiled by Dr. Araya for the municipal health authority. It is organized as numbered patient entries (intake records with somnographic data, followed by clinician notes and administrative status updates). The document also includes inter-office memoranda, instrument calibration logs, and margin annotations that Lourdes adds in a different voice — more personal, increasingly unraveled.

### Document Architecture and Narrative Arc

**Opening (Entries 1-3, ~800 words):** The document begins in perfect clinical form. Patient intake data, EEG readings, complaint descriptions. Bureaucratic headers, date stamps, referral codes. The first three patients are women aged 22-35 who present with a shared symptom: recurring nightmares involving a building they cannot describe upon waking, only that it had no windows and smelled of copper. Each entry concludes with a status line. The first: "Treatment ongoing." The second: "Patient failed to attend follow-up; file transferred to inactive." The third: "Patient failed to attend follow-up; missing persons report filed by family member (see Appendix C)." The clinical language is steady. Nothing is wrong yet. Everything is wrong.

**Inciting disruption (Entries 4-6, ~800 words):** The pattern becomes undeniable. Three more women, same dream architecture — the windowless building, the copper smell, the sense that the building is *inside them* or they are inside it. Lourdes's clinician notes grow longer. She begins cross-referencing the somnographic data and discovers that all six patients show an identical anomaly in their REM waveforms: a signature she has never seen in the literature, a frequency she privately names "the architecture frequency." An inter-office memo from the hospital administrator asks why so many patients have been transferred to inactive. Lourdes replies with a form letter. But in the margin of her own copy, she writes — in handwriting the document transcribes in italics — *Pilar had this same frequency. I checked. I went back and checked.*

**Escalating middle (Entries 7-13, ~1,800 words):** The entries accelerate. Each woman is briefly individualized — name, age, occupation, family contact, presenting complaint — and then absorbed into the pattern. A factory worker, a university student, a mother of three, a waitress, a pharmacy clerk, a retired teacher, a girl who lied about her age to get into the study (she is fifteen, not eighteen). The somnographic data becomes stranger: the "architecture frequency" intensifies with each patient, and Lourdes notes that the clinic's own EEG equipment seems to be *generating* the frequency, not just recording it. She requests a calibration check. The calibration report comes back normal. She requests another. Normal. In the margins, her annotations become longer, more fragmented, slipping from clinical observation into something resembling dream transcription. She begins recording her own sleep. She finds the frequency in her own data. An administrative note from the health authority requests that Lourdes stop filing missing persons cross-references in her clinical index — it is "outside the scope of the document." She does not stop. She adds an appendix: a list of dates, names, last known addresses. A litany.

**Crisis point (Entries 14-16, ~1,000 words):** Entry 14 is a woman named Renata Solis, 28, who tells Lourdes during intake that she has been dreaming of the clinic itself — that in her dream, the clinic has no exits, and the somnographic equipment is attached not to her scalp but growing *out of* it. Lourdes's clinical notes for this entry are three times longer than any previous entry. She describes Renata's dream in detail that exceeds what a patient interview could produce — as though Lourdes has *been in the dream with her*. Entry 15 is blank except for a patient number and the note: "Intake incomplete. Patient removed from waiting room by two men in unmarked vehicle. Attending physician [self] witnessed from window. Duration of observation: 14 seconds. No further action taken." Entry 16 is Lourdes's own somnographic record, submitted as a patient file. She has checked herself into her own study. Her intake form lists her presenting complaint as: "Recurring dream of compiling a document that never ends. The document is a building. The building has no windows. It smells of copper."

**Ending (Final section + administrative footer, ~800 words):** The index ends with an administrative section that should be routine: a summary table, aggregate statistics, a signature line. But the summary table lists seventeen patients, and the "status" column reads the same for all seventeen: "See Appendix C." Appendix C, which Lourdes was told to remove, is still there. It has grown. It now contains not just names and dates but fragments of the somnographic transcriptions — the dreams themselves, stitched together into a single continuous narrative that reads like a collective account of one enormous, shared experience of being taken into a building that is also a body that is also a city that is also a document. The final entry in Appendix C is undated and unsigned. It describes a woman compiling an index. The index is a building. She cannot find the exit. She can smell copper. The document's last line is the standard administrative footer: *"This index has been compiled in accordance with Municipal Health Authority Directive 11-47 and is certified as complete."* Below it, in what the transcription marks as handwriting: *It is not complete. None of them came back. I am the eighteenth.*

## 5. Key Scenes

- **Entry 3's status line** — The first mention of a missing persons report, buried in routine administrative language. This is where the reader understands what kind of document they are holding. It must be delivered with absolute clinical flatness — no emphasis, no alarm — because that flatness IS the horror. Reveals Lourdes's capacity to file atrocity under the correct heading.

- **The margin note about Pilar** — The first crack in the clinical voice. Lourdes's handwritten annotation connecting her sister's old polysomnogram to the current patients' anomalous frequency. This is where the personal breaks through the institutional, where the reader understands that Lourdes has been carrying a private reason for this work all along — and that the private reason has made her both more perceptive and more complicit.

- **Entry 10: the fifteen-year-old** — The girl who lied about her age. Lourdes knows she is underage and admits her to the study anyway, rationalizing that the data is important. This is the scene where Lourdes's flaw becomes action — where documentation-as-care becomes documentation-as-complicity. The girl does not return for follow-up. Her entry is the shortest in the index.

- **Entry 15: the abduction from the waiting room** — Fourteen seconds. Lourdes watches from the window. The clinical note is devastatingly minimal. "No further action taken." Four words that contain Lourdes's entire moral failure — and her entire human helplessness. This scene must do the work of showing that the system is not abstract; it has men in vehicles, it operates in daylight, and the people who witness it write notes and continue.

- **Entry 16: Lourdes checks herself in** — The moment the documenter becomes the documented. The clinician becomes the patient. The index swallows its author. This is where Lourdes finally acts — not by fighting the system but by submitting herself to it, by refusing to remain on the observing side of the clipboard. It is both surrender and the only honest thing she has done in the entire document.

## 6. The Emotional Trajectory

**Beginning**: The reader feels the low-grade unease of bureaucratic language applied to human bodies. Clinical competence. Trust in the document. A faint hum of wrongness beneath the procedural surface — like reading a coroner's report and realizing midway that you are reading many coroner's reports.

**Middle**: Dread accumulates. The repetition of the entries — each woman individualized just enough to be a person, then absorbed into the pattern — creates the same suffocating rhythm as Bolano's "Part About the Crimes." The reader begins to feel the weight of enumeration. The margin notes provide brief oxygen — Lourdes is human, Lourdes is noticing — but they also deepen the horror because noticing is not the same as stopping.

**End**: The reader should feel the floor give way. The document has consumed its author. The clinical frame, which promised legibility and order, has become the architecture of the nightmare it was meant to record. The final administrative footer — "certified as complete" — should land like a door closing. And Lourdes's last handwritten line should feel like a fist against that door. The reader puts this down feeling that systems of documentation are not neutral; that paperwork can be a grave; and that the only honest response to an impossible catalog of harm may be to add yourself to it.

## 7. Formula Integration

### Blake Butler (Author A) — Most visible in: Entries 7-13, the escalating middle
The somnographic data descriptions should channel Butler's incantatory body-horror prose. As the entries accumulate, the clinical language describing the patients' EEG readings should begin to *sound* like the dreams it is recording — sentences that dissolve and reform, the body as architecture, flesh and instrument blurring. The "architecture frequency" is pure Butler: a measurable phenomenon that is also a metaphysical condition, the sleeping body as a building you cannot leave. Paragraphs in this section should feel like they are decomposing on the page — the clinical format holding its shape while the content inside it liquefies.

### Roberto Bolano (Author B) — Most visible in: The full litany of entries (but especially the aggregate rhythm of Entries 4-13)
The entire document structure channels Bolano's "Part About the Crimes" — the catalog of disappeared women, each briefly individualized (name, age, occupation, last seen), each absorbed into a pattern too large to comprehend. The clinical distance is Bolano's clinical distance: atrocity reported with the flatness of a police blotter. The digressions — Lourdes's margin notes about Pilar, the calibration reports, the administrative memos — are Bolano's digressions: seemingly tangential material that becomes the emotional spine. The city (unnamed, border, desert-adjacent) is Bolano's Santa Teresa: a place where women disappear into a system that records their disappearance and does nothing else.

### 300,000,000 / Work X — Most visible in: Entry 16 (Lourdes's self-admission) and Appendix C
Butler's novel treats the sleeping body as a nation, as architecture. Entry 16, where Lourdes submits herself as a patient and describes her dream of compiling a document that is also a building, channels this directly. The numbered-section structure of the index mirrors 300,000,000's numbered entries — an impossible catalog that accumulates dread without traditional narrative progression. Appendix C, where the dreams are stitched into a single continuous narrative, should read like a passage from 300,000,000: the dissolution of boundary between self and sleep, between documenter and documented, between the body and the building it inhabits.

### 2666 / Work Y — Most visible in: Entry 15 (the abduction witnessed from the window) and the administrative friction
2666's "Part About the Crimes" is the DNA of this entire document — the litany of the dead as both memorial and indictment. But Entry 15 is where 2666's specific horror concentrates: the atrocity witnessed in daylight, reported in minimal language, followed by "no further action taken." The administrative notes — the health authority telling Lourdes to stop cross-referencing missing persons, the pressure to keep the document within its "scope" — channel 2666's vast invisible systems of cruelty: the institutions that are not exactly causing the violence but are maintaining the conditions under which it continues.

## 8. Technical Notes for the Writer

- **Document form**: The piece should look and feel like a clinical document — use entry headers, patient numbers, date stamps, status lines, memo formatting. But the form should degrade. Early entries are clean. Later entries bleed. The margin annotations (rendered in italics) are where Lourdes's human voice lives.

- **Names**: Every patient should be named. Full name, age, occupation. This is Bolano's method — individuation within enumeration. The names make it impossible to treat the catalog as abstraction. Do NOT use "Marcus" or "Chen" as names. Draw from Latin American naming conventions appropriate to the border-city setting.

- **The "architecture frequency"**: This is the story's central metaphor and should remain ambiguous. Is it a real neurological phenomenon? A malfunction in the equipment? Something supernatural? The document's clinical frame means Lourdes *cannot* speculate beyond her data — but the data itself becomes impossible, and the clinical frame's inability to contain what it is measuring IS the horror.

- **Pacing**: The first three entries should be brisk and procedural — establishing the document's voice and lulling the reader into the rhythm. The middle entries should slow down slightly as the annotations grow. The final three entries should feel like falling. The administrative footer should be one clean sentence after a long descent.

- **Tone**: Start at absolute clinical zero. End somewhere between prayer and autopsy. The transition should feel inevitable in retrospect and impossible to pinpoint in the reading.

- **Word count distribution**: ~800 words for opening entries (1-3), ~800 for the inciting section (4-6), ~1,800 for the accumulating middle (7-13), ~1,000 for the crisis (14-16), ~800 for the ending/appendix/footer. Total ~5,200.
