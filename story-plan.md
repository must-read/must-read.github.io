## Writing Samples

### Sample 1: Emily Henry (Author A) — Narrative voice, banter, vulnerability beneath humor

**Source**: Author A — Emily Henry's witty, self-aware first-person narration
**Origin**: Beach Read (Chapter 1, assorted passages), Book Lovers, People We Meet on Vacation, Funny Story
**Why representative**: These passages demonstrate Henry's signature blend of self-deprecating humor, sharp banter that masks real feeling, internal monologue that processes pain through wry observation, and physical attraction described with comic indignation.

**Opening voice — self-aware narration as emotional negotiation:**

> I have a fatal flaw. I like to think we all do. Or at least that makes it easier for me when I'm writing — building my heroines and heroes up around this one self-sabotaging trait, hinging everything that happens to them on a specific characteristic: the thing they learned to do to protect themselves and can't let go of, even when it stops serving them.
>
> Maybe, for example, you didn't have much control over your life as a kid. So, to avoid disappointment, you learned never to ask yourself what you truly wanted. And it worked for a long time. Only now, upon realizing you didn't get what you didn't know you wanted, you're barreling down the highway in a midlife-crisis-mobile with a suitcase full of cash and a man named Stan in your trunk. Or maybe, like me, you're a hopeless romantic.

**Banter as flirtation — dialogue that's really a contest for emotional territory:**

> "'I knew you in college, January.' 'That seems like the biggest in a series of vast exaggerations you've made tonight.' 'Fine, I knew of you.'"

> "'Come on, Gus,' I bumped his arm. 'You can do it. Be adorable.' His eyes darted to where I'd bumped him, then back to my face, and he scowled. 'I think you misunderstood me. I said adorable.'"

> "What's it like writing Hemingway circle-jerk fanfiction?"

> "'You're as small as you are ridiculous.' 'So not very?'"

**Physical attraction as comic grievance:**

> "Speaking of fire, sometimes his eyes seemed to be reflecting it, even though there wasn't any. The car was nearly pitch-black for God's sake. His eyes should not be allowed, physically or morally, to glint like that. His pupils were disrespectful to the laws of nature."

> "Sometimes I just missed _liking_ people."

**Vulnerability under the humor — the moments where the armor drops:**

> "Mom's first diagnosis taught me that love was an escapee rope, but it was her second diagnosis that taught me love could be a life vest when you were drowning."

> "The hardest thing had turned out to be being angry with someone you couldn't fight it out with."

> "He fit so perfectly in the love story I'd imagined for myself that I mistook him for the love of my life."

> "I can miss my dad and hate him at the same time."

From Funny Story:
> "Miles smiles tentatively, an apology of a smile: *Should I be here right now?* *You should always be here*, my heart answers."

> "This is how time works. The things you wait months for blink past, like the flash of a strobe, huge swaths lost in the dark beats between."

**Craft notes for the writer**: Henry's first-person narration confides — the narrator talks to you like a smart friend processing something in real time. Internal monologue oscillates between acerbic humor and sudden unguarded feeling. Banter works because both parties are genuinely clever and neither will yield; the humor masks a real contest for emotional territory. Physical attraction is described with comic indignation. Dialogue tags are minimal; voice does the work. The key Henry move: a funny observation that catches in the throat because the reader realizes what emotion it's covering.

### Sample 2: P.G. Wodehouse (Author B) — Comic precision, sentences as surprise machines

**Source**: Author B — Wodehouse's comic prose style
**Origin**: Right Ho, Jeeves; The Code of the Woosters; Very Good, Jeeves!; The Mating Season; assorted works
**Why representative**: These demonstrate Wodehouse's hallmark techniques — the elaborate simile that detonates at the end, the periodic sentence that delays its punchline, comic understatement, Bertie's confidently wrong narration, and the verbal performance of dialogue.

**The sentence as a perfectly engineered mechanism for surprise:**

> "He had the look of one who had drunk the cup of life and found a dead beetle at the bottom."

> "She looked as if she had been poured into her clothes and had forgotten to say 'when.'"

> "Unseen in the background, Fate was quietly slipping lead into the boxing-glove."

> "I could see that, if not actually disgruntled, he was far from being gruntled."

> "He groaned slightly and winced like Prometheus watching his vulture dropping in for lunch."

> "He felt like a man who, chasing rainbows, has had one of them suddenly turn and bite him in the leg."

> "A melancholy-looking man, he had the appearance of one who has searched for the leak in life's gas-pipe with a lighted candle."

> "The voice of Love seemed to call to me, but it was a wrong number."

> "Freddie experienced the sort of abysmal soul-sadness which afflicts one of Tolstoy's Russian peasants when, after trudging miles across the steppe to where his sweetheart lives, he is met at the door by her and told that she has married someone else."

> "A sort of gulpy, gurgly, plobby, squishy, wofflesome sound, like a thousand eager men drinking soup in a foreign restaurant."

> "And she's got brains enough for two, which is the exact quantity the girl who marries you will need."

**Bertie Wooster's confidently wrong narration:**

> "There are moments, Jeeves, when one asks oneself, 'Do trousers matter?'" / "'The mood will pass, sir.'"

> "I'm not absolutely certain of the facts, but I rather fancy it's Shakespeare who says..."

> "I loosed it down the hatch, and after undergoing the passing discomfort, unavoidable when you drink Jeeves's patented morning revivers, of having the top of the skull fly up to the ceiling and the eyes shoot out of their sockets and rebound from the opposite wall like racquet balls, felt better. It would have been overstating it to say that even now Bertram was back again in mid-season form, but I had at least slid into the convalescent class and was equal to a spot of conversation."

**Physical description as comic mechanism:**

> "A tall, drooping man, looking as if he had been stuffed in a hurry by an incompetent taxidermist."

> "Bicky rocked, like a jelly in a high wind."

> "I clutched at the brow. The mice in my interior had now got up an informal dance and were buck-and-winging all over the place like a bunch of Nijinskys."

**Craft notes for the writer**: Wodehouse builds sentences the way a watchmaker builds mechanisms — every clause sets up the final detonation. His similes yoke the cosmic to the mundane. Narrators are supremely confident and consistently wrong. Dialogue is performance — slightly heightened register that stays just this side of absurd. Comedy arises from the gap between what characters believe about themselves and what the reader can see. Understatement and litotes create humor through rhetorical precision. The writer should channel this into: elaborate metaphors that land with a comic twist, a narrator whose self-assessment is hilariously off-base, and set-piece sequences where small misunderstandings escalate through perfect mechanical logic.

### Sample 3: Beach Read (Work X) — Rivals-to-lovers via a bet/challenge

**Source**: Work X — Beach Read structural architecture
**Origin**: Beach Read by Emily Henry, plot summary and structural analysis
**Why representative**: This captures the bones the story must echo — the bet as romantic catalyst, forced proximity, mutual transformation, and the reveal that punctures self-narratives.

**Structure to internalize**:

Beach Read follows January Andrews (romance novelist) and Augustus Everett (literary fiction writer) — college rivals who end up as lake-house neighbors in Michigan. Both have writer's block tied to personal crises: January has discovered her late father's infidelity, shattering her belief in love stories. Gus carries trauma from an abusive father and failed marriage.

The central catalyst is the bet: they challenge each other to write in the other's genre. January will attempt dark literary fiction; Gus will attempt a happy ending. This forces each into the other's worldview — January must confront darkness she's been avoiding, Gus must believe joy is possible.

The "educational outings" structure provides weekly set-piece scenes where they guide each other through research, creating escalating intimacy. Physical attraction builds alongside genuine intellectual respect.

The reveal: January discovers Gus's ex-wife and deeper emotional wounds. Gus discovers January's father's love was real even though imperfect. Both characters' self-narratives are punctured — January's "love is pure and simple" fantasy AND Gus's "happiness is naivete" cynicism are both wrong. The truth is messier and more beautiful.

**Key structural elements to borrow**: (1) The bet/challenge that forces protagonists into each other's territory; (2) recurring set-piece meetings that escalate both comedy and intimacy; (3) the reveal that neither character's self-story is accurate; (4) professional/intellectual territory as metaphor for emotional territory.

### Sample 4: Right Ho, Jeeves (Work Y) — Cascading catastrophe of good intentions

**Source**: Work Y — Right Ho, Jeeves thematic engine and plot mechanics
**Origin**: Right Ho, Jeeves by P.G. Wodehouse, plot summary and structural analysis
**Why representative**: This captures the thematic architecture — cascading good intentions creating catastrophe, ensemble subplots that collide, and the gap between self-image and reality as comic engine.

**Themes and mechanics to internalize**:

In Right Ho, Jeeves, Bertie Wooster decides he can outdo Jeeves at solving romantic problems. He attempts to help Gussie Fink-Nottle court Madeline Bassett and to reconcile his cousin Angela with Tuppy Glossop. Each intervention makes everything worse in ways that are both logical and catastrophic.

The ensemble mechanics: Bertie gives Gussie brandy for courage — Gussie gets spectacularly drunk, proposes to Madeline during a chaotic school prize-giving, then gets dumped. Heartbroken drunk Gussie proposes to Angela (to spite Madeline); Angela accepts (to spite Tuppy). Tuppy goes berserk chasing Gussie around the mansion. Aunt Dahlia's French chef Anatole threatens to resign. Every thread pulls on every other thread until the entire social fabric unravels.

The comic engine: Bertie's self-image as a capable operator is hilariously divorced from reality. He genuinely believes he's helping. His narration brims with confidence even as every plan collapses. The distance between his self-assessment and actual results is the primary comedy source.

The resolution: Jeeves solves everything in the few hours Bertie is absent, demonstrating that the best thing the would-be helper can do is get out of the way. But Bertie learns nothing — essential to the comedy.

**Key thematic elements to borrow**: (1) A protagonist who believes they're brilliant at relationships while being catastrophically bad at them; (2) multiple romantic subplots that collide because of the protagonist's meddling; (3) good intentions that mechanically produce the worst possible outcomes; (4) the gap between self-image and reality played for both comedy AND eventual emotional truth; (5) ensemble cast where every subplot pulls on the others.

## Story Design

### 1. Premise

Juliet Fawley, an events coordinator who has never sustained a relationship past four months, runs a side hustle as a self-appointed "relationship fixer" for her friend group — dispensing advice, engineering meet-cutes, orchestrating grand gestures — with a success rate she generously estimates at "quite good" and everyone else knows is zero. When she's hired to plan the engagement party of two friends she secretly helped get together (and who are now, thanks to her latest advice, barely speaking), she must un-destroy their relationship while sharing every planning session with Elliot Yoon, a conflict mediator who finds her methods genuinely horrifying and whose calm, logical approach to human emotion makes her want to scream. The bet: she'll plan the party her way, he'll handle the couple his way, and whoever fixes the relationship first gets full creative control of the event.

### 2. Protagonist

**Juliet Fawley**, 30, events coordinator at a mid-tier hotel in Portland, Oregon. She plans other people's happy endings for a living and moonlights as her friend group's unofficial relationship counselor. She once texted a friend's crush from the friend's phone — without permission — a sonnet she found online, which led to a spectacular public breakup at a farmers' market involving thrown peaches.

- **What she WANTS**: To prove that her instincts about love are right — that romance requires boldness, big gestures, and a willingness to make a fool of yourself. To fix Priya and Dev's engagement before the party she's planning celebrates a love that may no longer exist.
- **What she NEEDS**: To understand that fixing other people's relationships is easier than examining why she can't sustain her own — that her compulsive meddling is a way of experiencing intimacy at arm's length, participating in love stories without risking being the protagonist of one.
- **Her flaw**: She genuinely believes she understands love better than the people actually in it. She's read every romance novel, seen every movie, and has internalized the grammar of courtship so thoroughly that she mistakes pattern recognition for emotional wisdom. She is Bertie Wooster with a Pinterest board — supremely confident, constitutionally incapable of recognizing that her grand plans are the problem. Her specific wound: her parents had an ugly divorce when she was twelve, and her mother told her, "Your father never once made a gesture that wasn't about himself." Juliet took this to mean gestures must be selfless and enormous. She never considered that her mother might have been wrong, or at least not entirely right.

### 3. Structure

**Opening image**: Juliet, in her car outside a restaurant, is coaching her friend Priya through an earpiece on how to respond to Dev's toast at their engagement dinner. ("No, don't touch his hand yet — wait for the callback to the story about the umbrella.") It's going beautifully until Juliet's increasingly specific stage directions cause Priya to knock over a candle, set a napkin on fire, and accidentally reveal the earpiece. Dev storms out. Juliet, watching through the restaurant window, murmurs into the dead earpiece: "That wasn't supposed to be the callback."

**Inciting disruption**: The engagement party is in three weeks, it's already paid for, and now the engaged couple aren't speaking. Priya's mother, Mrs. Rajan, is Juliet's most important client. Juliet cannot let this party fail. But Priya, furious about the earpiece incident, has banned Juliet from all relationship advice and instead hired a professional — Elliot Yoon, a workplace conflict mediator who "also does personal." When Juliet and Elliot meet at the first planning session, their approaches collide immediately: she wants to engineer a grand romantic gesture to remind Priya and Dev why they fell in love; he wants to put them in a room and let them talk. The bet crystallizes: they'll each get a week to try their approach. If Juliet's method works, Elliot stays out of the party planning. If Elliot's works, Juliet agrees to stop giving unsolicited relationship advice — permanently.

**Escalating middle**: Juliet's Week One gambit: she orchestrates a "spontaneous" re-creation of Priya and Dev's first date (same restaurant, same rain, same accidentally-ordered dish neither of them liked). It nearly works — until Dev discovers the setup and feels manipulated. Worse: Juliet has also been advising two other couples in the friend group (Ravi and Suki, who are fighting about a dog; Tomas and Bea, who can't agree on where to live), and her advice starts creating crossover chaos. She tells Ravi to "show up with the puppy as a surprise" — the puppy escapes and destroys Priya's mother's garden. She tells Tomas to write Bea a letter confessing his true feelings — Tomas accidentally sends it to the friend group chat. Each subplot collision worsens the one before it, Wodehouse-style.

Meanwhile, Elliot's calm approach is slowly, infuriatingly working. He listens. He asks questions. He doesn't try to script anyone's feelings. And he keeps showing up at Juliet's planning sessions with observations that are both devastatingly correct and maddeningly gentle. ("You built a beautiful version of their first date. But it was your version. Have you ever asked them what they remember about it?") Juliet and Elliot's planning meetings — ostensibly about the party — become increasingly charged. They argue about love like it's a philosophical position. She accuses him of being so afraid of mess that he'll never experience real passion. He suggests that her addiction to grand gestures might be a way of avoiding the terrifying simplicity of just... telling someone how you feel.

**Crisis point**: Everything collides at the "practice dinner" Juliet has organized (a dry run for the engagement party, because of course she has). Ravi shows up with the recaptured puppy. Tomas shows up with a guitar (Juliet's idea). Bea shows up with a real estate agent (Elliot's suggestion, which Juliet has misunderstood and amplified). The puppy knocks over Tomas's music stand. The real estate agent starts pitching Priya's mother on selling her house. Dev, who has quietly arrived hoping to reconcile with Priya, sees the chaos and assumes Juliet has orchestrated another scheme. He tells Priya: "This is what it'll always be. Your friends running our relationship." Priya looks at Juliet and says, "He's right."

This is the moment Juliet's self-narrative shatters. She sees herself through their eyes: not a woman who understands love, but a woman so afraid of her own love life that she colonizes everyone else's. Elliot finds her outside, sitting on the back steps. For the first time, she doesn't perform. She doesn't have a plan. She says, "I think I might be the reason none of this works." He doesn't reassure her. He just sits down.

**Ending**: Juliet goes to Priya alone. No script, no earpiece, no orchestrated moment. She apologizes — not the grand-gesture apology she would have planned a week ago, but a real one, clumsy and incomplete. She says she doesn't know how to fix it, which is the first honest thing she's said about relationships in years. Priya and Dev reconcile on their own terms, in their own time, before the party. The party happens — simpler than Juliet planned. She's given up control of the playlist, the seating chart, the toast structure. When Elliot asks her to dance, she doesn't choreograph the moment. She says yes. On the dance floor, she tells him she's terrible at this. "At dancing?" "At being in the story instead of writing it." He says, "I've noticed." But he doesn't let go of her hand. The final image: Juliet's phone buzzes. It's Ravi, asking for advice about proposing to Suki. Juliet stares at the text. Her thumbs hover. She locks the phone and puts it in her pocket. Then she unlocks it, types "Ask her what she wants," and puts it away for real.

### 4. Key Scenes

- **The earpiece disaster** (opening): Establishes Juliet's modus operandi AND her blind spot in a single comic set-piece. The comedy comes from the precision of her stage directions collapsing in real time. Reveals character: she's not malicious, she's genuinely trying to help, which makes the catastrophe funnier and sadder.

- **The first Juliet-Elliot planning session**: Their fundamental worldview clash plays out through party planning logistics. She wants a curated Spotify playlist that tells the story of Priya and Dev's relationship in chronological order. He wants to ask them what songs matter to them. The argument about the playlist is really an argument about whether love is something you design or something you discover. This is the scene where the reader realizes these two are going to fall for each other and both of them are going to be the last to know.

- **The re-created first date**: Juliet's most ambitious scheme, executed with maximum competence and minimum understanding. The scene should be genuinely touching for a moment — she's gotten the details perfect, the restaurant is beautiful, Priya tears up — before the whole thing detonates when Dev finds the planning binder Juliet accidentally left in the coat check. The comedy is in the gap between the perfection of the setup and the fundamental wrongness of the premise.

- **The practice dinner catastrophe**: The Wodehouse collision scene where every subplot crashes into every other simultaneously. The puppy, the guitar, the real estate agent, the music stand — each element individually reasonable, together absolute pandemonium. But the real punch is emotional: Dev's quiet "This is what it'll always be" lands harder than any slapstick.

- **Juliet and Elliot on the back steps**: The scene where comedy gives way to genuine vulnerability. No banter, no performance. Henry's emotional register takes over — the moment when being funny stops working as armor. Elliot doesn't fix her. He just stays.

### 5. Emotional Trajectory

The reader begins in **delight** — Juliet is charming, her schemes are elaborate and fun, her narration is sharp and self-aware enough that we're laughing with her even as we see the disasters approaching. The earpiece sequence should produce genuine laughs. By the middle, delight shifts to **comic dread mixed with anticipation** — we can see the collisions coming, we know the practice dinner will be a catastrophe, and we're watching Juliet fall for Elliot while absolutely refusing to acknowledge it. The crisis produces a sharp pivot to **recognition** — not pity, but the uncomfortable feeling of seeing someone realize a truth about themselves they've been elaborate about avoiding. The ending leaves the reader with **warm, complicated hope** — not the sugar-rush of a perfect resolution, but the feeling that Juliet has taken one genuine step toward being brave about her own heart, and that she'll probably relapse a little (the phone scene), and that this is how real change actually works. The final emotion is tenderness cut with a knowing laugh.

### 6. Formula Integration

**Emily Henry (Author A)** — Most visible in: Juliet's first-person narration throughout, but concentrated in the scenes where she describes Elliot with comic indignation. The way she catalogs his annoying qualities ("He listens like he's being paid for it, which, I suppose, he is") should carry Henry's signature blend of attraction-expressed-as-grievance. Her internal monologue when she realizes she's staring at his hands during a planning session. The banter between Juliet and Elliot should have Henry's rhythm: fast, competitive, each person trying to win while secretly hoping to be understood.

**P.G. Wodehouse (Author B)** — Most visible in: The practice dinner catastrophe scene, which should be engineered with Wodehouse's mechanical precision — each element introduced innocently, each collision producing exactly the worst possible result, the whole sequence escalating with the beautiful inevitability of a Rube Goldberg machine. Also in Juliet's extended similes and metaphors ("He looked at me the way a very patient border collie looks at a sheep that has not only left the flock but has somehow gotten on a motorcycle") and her narration's supreme, unfounded confidence.

**Beach Read (Work X)** — Most visible in: The bet/challenge structure, the forced proximity of the planning sessions, and the moment of mutual transformation. The "educational outings" parallel is the planning sessions themselves — each one brings Juliet and Elliot closer while ostensibly being about Priya and Dev. The reveal that punctures both self-narratives: Juliet's revelation that she meddles to avoid vulnerability, and Elliot's eventual admission (implied, not stated) that his professional calm is its own kind of armor.

**Right Ho, Jeeves (Work Y)** — Most visible in: The cascading-catastrophe structure of the middle section, where every fix creates a new problem. Juliet is Bertie Wooster — certain she's helping, constitutionally unable to see that she IS the problem. The ensemble subplots (Ravi/Suki, Tomas/Bea) serve the same function as Wodehouse's subplot collisions — they're individually manageable, but Juliet's meddling links them into a single Gordian knot. The thematic engine: good intentions as the most destructive force in romance.

### 7. Title

**Unsolicited**

This title works on multiple levels: Juliet's unsolicited advice, her unsolicited interventions in other people's love lives, and — by the end — the unsolicited feelings she discovers for Elliot, which she never planned for and can't orchestrate. It's punchy, slightly wry, and doesn't start with "The." It diverges from the existing title patterns (no gerunds, no possessives, no "of" constructions). Single-word titles have energy and confidence, which suits the comic register.

## Notes for the Writer Agent

**Prose voice**: First person, present tense for immediacy. Juliet's narration should blend Henry's confiding warmth with Wodehouse's elaborate comic constructions. She is smart, self-aware about everything except herself, and her sentences should have both Henry's emotional precision and Wodehouse's mechanical surprise. She notices the right details but draws the wrong conclusions.

**Comedy mechanics**: This must be GENUINELY FUNNY. Not literary fiction with a smile, but a story that produces real laughs. The earpiece scene, the puppy escape, the group-chat letter, the practice dinner — these are comic set-pieces that need timing, escalation, and payoff. Wodehouse's method: introduce each element innocently, let the reader see the collision approaching, then execute it with worse-than-expected results. Henry's method: the funniest line is the one that, two seconds later, you realize was also the saddest.

**Emotional stakes**: The comedy must coexist with real vulnerability. The back-steps scene (Juliet and Elliot after the catastrophe) is the emotional center of the story. It should earn its quiet by the volume of comedy that preceded it. Don't rush it. Let the silence do work.

**What NOT to do**:
- Don't make Juliet a screw-up played for pity. She's competent at everything except the one thing she thinks she's best at. That's the comedy.
- Don't make Elliot boring or purely the "reasonable one." He should be funny in his own right — dry, unexpected, capable of surprising Juliet. His calm should occasionally crack and reveal something complicated underneath.
- Don't resolve the Juliet-Elliot romance fully. The dance, the hand, the conversation — these are a beginning, not a happily-ever-after. The open thread is whether she'll actually let this become something real.
- Don't let the ensemble subplots overwhelm. Ravi/Suki and Tomas/Bea exist to create collision material and to demonstrate Juliet's pattern. They should be sketched economically — a sentence or two of setup, then they pay off in the catastrophe scene.
- Don't announce the theme. Juliet should never say "I've been meddling to avoid my own feelings." The reader should feel it; Juliet should almost-say it and then deflect into humor, except once, on the back steps, when she doesn't.

**What TO do**:
- Make the banter crackle. Juliet and Elliot arguing about playlists, seating charts, and toast structures should be as charged as any love scene. They're talking about party planning but they're really talking about what love is.
- Use the Wodehouse escalation in the practice dinner. Each new arrival should make the reader's dread-delight increase. The reader should be thinking "no, no, no" while laughing.
- Give Juliet at least one extended Wodehouse-style simile per major scene — the kind that builds through three clauses and lands on something unexpected.
- The phone scene at the end must be precise. The impulse to meddle, the restraint, the relapse into one piece of genuinely good advice ("Ask her what she wants") — this is the thread left open. She's changing, but she's not changed.
