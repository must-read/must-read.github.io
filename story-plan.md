## 1. Premise

A woman named Dahl checks herself into a county detox facility after totaling her car in a strip mall parking lot. She keeps rewriting the story of what happened — who she was before, what the car hit, whether there was a child in the crosswalk or just a shopping cart — and the text itself cannot hold a stable version. Two other voices intrude: a male orderly named Fitz who is writing his own account of the woman in room 6 as a kind of love letter or confession, and a third voice that might be Dahl's earlier self, or might be someone she killed, or might be the story she stole from a book she found in the facility's waiting room. The question the story asks: **Can a person who has destroyed her own narrative coherence still arrive at something that functions like grace — and would she even recognize it?**

## 2. Protagonists

### Voice 1: Dahl, 31

A former adjunct writing instructor who lost the position, then the apartment, then the car, then any stable sense of what order those things happened in. Currently in a 72-hour detox hold after the parking lot incident. Amphetamines and alcohol, in combination, for two years.

- **WANTS**: To write down what happened accurately — to produce one true account of the parking lot, the months before, the person she was. She keeps a composition notebook the facility gave her.
- **NEEDS**: To stop rewriting herself. Her compulsion to revise is the same compulsion that drove the addiction — the belief that the next version will be the one that holds. She needs to let a version be ugly and final.
- **FLAW**: She cannot stop performing her own damage. Every account of her wreckage is also a seduction — she's brilliant at making her destruction beautiful, which means she never has to actually look at it. The prose is always better than the life.

### Voice 2: Fitz, 44

Night orderly at the facility. Former paramedic who quit after a call he won't describe directly. Divorced. Lives in a studio apartment above a laundromat. Has worked at the facility for three years.

- **WANTS**: To understand the woman in room 6, who he has been watching through the observation window. He writes about her in a pocket notebook — ostensibly part of his patient notes but actually something private, confessional, strange.
- **NEEDS**: To stop using other people's crises as a substitute for facing his own. His tenderness toward patients is real but it's also a way of never being the one on the bed.
- **FLAW**: He believes witnessing suffering is the same as experiencing it. He thinks his proximity to pain makes him holy. It doesn't.

### Voice 3: "She" / The Stolen Voice

This voice has no name. It speaks in third person about a woman who may or may not be Dahl. The prose is colder, more clinical, sexually frank, and sometimes shifts without warning into appropriated text — fragments that sound like they come from a medical intake form, a romance novel, a driver's ed manual, a letter never sent. This voice might be:
- Dahl's earlier self, before the collapse
- A character from a book Dahl read and can no longer distinguish from memory
- The version of events that's actually true, stripped of Dahl's self-mythologizing
- Someone Dahl hurt who is now narrating her from the outside

The story never clarifies which. The ambiguity is the point.

- **WANTS**: To be heard. To exist outside Dahl's revisions.
- **NEEDS**: Nothing. This voice might not be a person.
- **FLAW**: If this is a person, her flaw is that she has been reduced to text. If this is text, it has no flaw. This is the problem.

## 3. Structure

### Opening Image
Dahl's voice. She is writing in the composition notebook. The first paragraph appears to be a straightforward account of the parking lot incident — time, place, substance, impact — but by the third sentence, it has shifted tense, then person, then the parking lot has become a different parking lot from a different year. The notebook itself is unreliable. She crosses things out. The crossed-out things might be truer than what replaces them.

First line should be something like a clinical statement that immediately destabilizes: a time, a date, a fact — then the fact rots.

### The Inciting Disruption
Dahl finds a paperback novel in the facility's common room — water-damaged, missing its cover and first thirty pages. She starts reading it and realizes (or convinces herself) that the novel is about her. Not metaphorically. The character has her name, or a name close enough. The events are wrong but the feelings are right. She begins copying passages from the book into her notebook, interleaving them with her own account. She can no longer tell which sentences are hers.

This is where Voice 3 enters the text. It may be the book. It may be Dahl ventriloquizing. It may be neither.

### The Escalating Middle
Three movements, intercut:

**Movement A (Dahl's notebook):** Her attempts to write the parking lot become increasingly fractured. Each version reveals different details — in one, she was alone; in another, there was a passenger; in another, she wasn't driving at all. The versions don't converge. They proliferate. She starts writing about her body — what the amphetamines did to her teeth, her skin, her ability to orgasm. The prose gets graphic, Acker-raw, sentences that are half confession and half assault on the reader. She writes about her father. Then crosses out the father and writes a different father. Then crosses out fathers entirely.

**Movement B (Fitz's notes):** His observations of the woman in room 6 are initially clinical — sleep patterns, food intake, behavior during group. But they slide. He starts describing the way she holds the pen, the sound she makes when she sleeps, a dream he had about her that he writes down and then attributes to a "patient." He describes a moment when he brought her a cup of water at 3 AM and she looked at him and said something he couldn't hear through the glass. He is falling into something — not love exactly, but the addiction of witnessing. He describes the paramedic call he never talks about: a woman in a car, a parking lot, but the details are wrong for Dahl's story. Or right. The overlap is nauseating.

**Movement C (Voice 3):** Fragments. A woman drives through a city at night. She is looking for something. The prose is stripped, affectless, then suddenly pornographic, then suddenly quoting what sounds like a textbook on trauma bonding. A list appears — items found in a car after an accident. A paragraph about the mechanics of a human body hitting a windshield, written with the precision of an autopsy report and the tenderness of a love letter. This voice knows things about Dahl that Dahl hasn't written yet.

### The Crisis Point
Fitz enters Dahl's room during his night shift. She is awake, writing. He reads over her shoulder — a violation he knows is a violation. What he reads does not match any version of events he has been told. It matches his own paramedic call. The woman in the car. The parking lot. He backs out of the room without speaking.

Dahl, in her notebook, writes: "The orderly came in. He read what I wrote. He recognized it. This is how I know it's true — when someone else's face breaks."

But we don't know if Fitz actually entered the room. His own account of that night describes standing outside the door and never opening it.

### The Ending
The three voices do not converge. Instead:

Dahl writes one final version of the parking lot. This version is simple, plain, short. No performance. No beauty. It is probably the truest version — the one where she was alone, where she hit nothing, where the car stopped in an empty lot and she sat there for two hours before calling 911 on herself. The damage was all internal. There was no child, no shopping cart, no passenger. Just a woman in a car who had stopped being able to drive.

Fitz, in his last entry, describes finding Dahl's notebook on the bed after she is discharged. He reads it. He puts it in his locker. He does not return it. He writes: "I will keep this. I don't know why. I think she left it on purpose. I think she wanted someone to hold the versions she couldn't."

Voice 3 delivers the final paragraph: a fragment about a woman walking out of a building into sunlight, and the sunlight is wrong — too bright, too thick, like a liquid. The sentence structure breaks down. The paragraph does not end so much as stop, mid-phrase, as if the book it was stolen from had its last pages torn out.

The story ends without ending. Grace is not achieved — but something was witnessed, and something was left behind for someone else to carry. That might be enough. The text doesn't say. The text can't say. The text is over.

## 4. Key Scenes

- **The parking lot variations**: Dahl writes three incompatible versions of the crash, each revealing different wounds. The reader must hold all three as simultaneously possible. This is the story's engine — the inability to produce a single truth. Each version is 200-400 words, and they should feel like they could each be the real one.

- **Fitz at the observation window, 3 AM**: He watches Dahl sleep and writes about it. The prose slips from clinical to devotional without him noticing. He describes the way the fluorescent light makes her look dead, then corrects himself — "not dead, blessed," then crosses that out too. This is where Johnson's spiritual yearning meets Acker's refusal of sentimentality.

- **The stolen book**: Dahl reads passages from the coverless novel aloud in group therapy. The other patients are confused. The counselor asks her to stop. She doesn't stop. The passages are about a woman who sounds like her but isn't, doing things she did but differently. The scene should feel like a séance — she is channeling a text that is channeling her.

- **Fitz's paramedic memory**: Told in fragments across his sections, never as a complete narrative. A woman. A parking lot. A windshield. The way blood looks on asphalt under sodium lights. He never says what happened to the woman. The reader assembles it from shards. The overlap with Dahl's story is deliberate and never explained.

- **The discharge**: Dahl leaves the facility. The scene is told by all three voices, each version incompatible. In one, Fitz watches her go. In another, he's not on shift. In Voice 3, the woman walks out into light that behaves like water. No version is privileged. The reader chooses.

## 5. The Emotional Trajectory

The reader begins in **disorientation** — the text refuses to settle, the narrator is unreliable, the form is aggressive. This should feel like vertigo, like the floor of the story is not where you expected it.

Through the middle, disorientation gives way to **recognition** — the reader starts to understand that the instability IS the content. Dahl's inability to write a stable account of herself is the wound, not a symptom of the wound. The reader begins to feel **implicated** — holding multiple versions of a person, deciding which one is real, is something readers do with every narrative. The text is making you aware of that.

At the crisis, the reader should feel **invaded** — the overlapping details between Fitz's memory and Dahl's account create a nauseating vertigo, a sense that stories are parasitic, that one person's trauma can migrate into another person's body.

The ending should leave the reader feeling **hollowed and strangely held**. Not catharsis. Not devastation. Something more like the feeling after a fever breaks — you're still weak, the room still smells like sickness, but light is coming through the window and it looks new. The grace is not earned. It shows up anyway, in the wrong form, at the wrong time, and nobody in the story is equipped to receive it. The reader might be.

## 6. Formula Integration

### Author A — Kathy Acker
**Most visible in**: Dahl's notebook entries, particularly the section where she writes about her body. The prose should be Acker-jagged: short declarative sentences, then a long obscene run-on, then a fragment of tenderness. Sexual content as political act — Dahl writing about what amphetamines did to her sexuality is not titillation, it's reclamation of a body that substances colonized. She should appropriate text — from the stolen novel, from medical forms, from a letter her father may or may not have written — and weave it into her own account without quotation marks, without attribution, until the reader cannot tell what's "hers." The narrator's identity should be unstable: in one passage, Dahl says "I," then shifts to "she," then to "you," within the same paragraph, as if even the pronoun can't hold.

### Author B — Denis Johnson
**Most visible in**: Fitz's sections. His prose should have Johnson's spare, weird, unpredictable rhythm — a mind that notices the wrong details. He describes a fluorescent light's hum but not a patient's scream. He describes the way a mop handle feels in his hand at 4 AM with the precision most writers reserve for sunsets. The spiritual yearning should be present but never named — Fitz doesn't know he's looking for grace, he thinks he's just doing his job. The moment where he watches Dahl through the observation window should have the quality of Johnson's hospital scenes in "Emergency" — luminous, wrong, holy in a way that embarrasses everyone.

### Work X — Blood and Guts in High School
**Most visible in**: The overall structure. The story should feel like collage, not narrative. Paragraphs that begin in one voice and end in another. Sections that look like they belong to different stories. The text should include non-prose elements: a list of items found in Dahl's car. A fragment that reads like a dream transcription. A paragraph formatted like a medical intake form. The anti-narrative accumulation — the story doesn't progress toward resolution, it accretes. Each section adds material but doesn't advance a plot. The stolen book is a direct echo of Acker's plagiaristic method — text consumed and rewritten until authorship dissolves.

### Work Y — Jesus' Son
**Most visible in**: The emotional arc and the ending. The sense that these damaged, confused people are on an accidental pilgrimage toward something they can't name. The story should feel like it ends in the wrong place — the discharge is not a climax, it's an interruption. Grace arrives, if it arrives at all, in the form of sunlight that behaves wrong, a notebook left behind, an orderly who keeps a stranger's pages in his locker. The miracles are in the wrong form: not recovery, not redemption, but a woman walking out of a building and the light being too thick, too present, too much like something living.

## 7. Title

**Versions of the Parking Lot**

This title:
- Does not start with "The"
- Signals the multiple-versions/multiple-voices structure
- Grounds the surrealism in a banal, specific location (parking lot)
- Echoes both Acker (versions, rewrites, the text as unstable) and Johnson (the parking lot as site of wreckage and accidental revelation)
- Does not duplicate any existing title structure in the corpus

## Notes for the Writer Agent

- The three voices should be **formally distinct** on the page. Dahl's sections: frantic, overwritten, beautiful-ugly, shifting pronouns. Fitz's sections: spare, observational, accidentally devotional. Voice 3: cold, fragmented, interpolated with appropriated text.
- **Do not resolve the contradictions.** The reader should finish the story holding at least two incompatible truths. This is not a puzzle to be solved.
- **Sexual content** should be present in Dahl's sections — frank, unglamorous, Acker-direct. Not erotica. The body as a site of damage and reclamation.
- **The stolen book** should never be identified. No author, no title, no genre. It is a text that exists to be consumed and rewritten.
- Section breaks should be **abrupt**. No transitions. The reader is dropped into each voice without preparation.
- The prose should run **hot and compressed**. Both Acker and Johnson write in bursts. Long, sustained passages of description or reflection would violate both sources. Keep it jagged.
- **Fitz should never be heroic.** His tenderness is real but it's also a kind of theft. He is taking something from Dahl — her story, her suffering, her pages — and calling it care.
- The ending is **three endings, none of which is an ending.** This is the structural enactment of the story's theme: there is no stable version. There is only what you're willing to carry.
