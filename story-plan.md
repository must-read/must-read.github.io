## 1. Premise

A woman living alone in a saltbox house on the Massachusetts coast keeps a meticulous domestic routine — gardening, preserving, cooking elaborate meals for two — and narrates her days with serene contentment, referring often to her husband Alden who is "resting upstairs." Over the course of the story, through accumulating domestic details and the narrator's own unguarded admissions, the reader comes to understand that Alden has been dead for a very long time, that the narrator knows this perfectly well, and that what she is tending so carefully is not a marriage but a body.

## 2. Protagonist

**Name**: Elodie Parrish
**Age**: 58
**Situation**: Lives in a remote house on a spit of land outside Harwich Port, Cape Cod. The house belonged to Alden's family for four generations. She has no children. Her nearest neighbor is a quarter mile down the road. She has not left the property in an indeterminate amount of time.

**What she WANTS (conscious goal)**: To maintain the house perfectly — the garden weeded, the preserves put up, the meals cooked, the linens laundered — so that when Alden is "feeling better," everything will be exactly as it should be. She wants the outside world to stay outside. She wants nothing to change.

**What she NEEDS (the truth she refuses to see)**: She does not refuse to see it. She sees it clearly. She simply does not experience it as horror. Alden is dead. He has been dead for what appears to be months, possibly longer. She continues to care for him — she brings meals upstairs, she opens the windows for fresh air, she speaks to him — with the same devotion she showed when he was alive. The distinction between alive and dead has become, for Elodie, a matter of degree rather than kind. She needs nothing. That is what makes her terrifying.

**Her flaw or blind spot**: Elodie is not delusional. She is something worse: she is at peace. She has absorbed the fact of Alden's death into her domestic routine the way she absorbs everything — by tending to it. She washes him. She changes his bedding. She does not pretend he is alive; she simply treats death as another condition requiring care, like the flu or a bad back. Her narration never lies. She tells the reader exactly what she does each day. She just doesn't flag any of it as wrong, because to her, it isn't.

## 3. Structure

### Opening (pages 1-3, ~1,200 words): The Sealed World

Elodie narrates a typical day. She wakes early, tends her garden (salt-tolerant roses, herbs, a vegetable patch behind a windbreak), walks the property checking fences and gates, prepares breakfast. She mentions Alden — he is "resting upstairs," he "had a difficult night." She carries a tray up. She describes the house with loving precision: the worn pine floors, the lace at the windows her mother-in-law made, the pantry stocked with her preserves. She is deeply, genuinely content. The prose is warm, unhurried, Jackson-domestic: the rituals of a woman who has made her home a universe.

**Reader experience**: Charmed. A quiet portrait of a woman alone (or nearly alone) in a beautiful old house. The husband upstairs is ill. She is devoted. Something about her contentment is almost too perfect, but we don't yet know why.

**Seeds planted** (the reader may not register these on first read):
- She mentions "the smell" in passing, attributing it to the salt marsh. She has placed lavender sachets everywhere.
- She never quotes Alden speaking. She says "Alden thinks" and "Alden prefers," but these are always her interpretations.
- The garden has an unusual number of flies. She finds this annoying but unsurprising — "it's the marsh."
- She describes closing the front gate and checking the latch with a precision that feels protective — or imprisoning.

### Early Signals (pages 3-6, ~1,500 words): The Cracks Appear

Elodie's narration continues through several days (she marks time by meals and garden tasks, not by dates). The reader begins to notice:

- She prepares elaborate meals, carries them upstairs, and later retrieves the trays. The food is always untouched. She attributes this to Alden's poor appetite and eats the portions herself, matter-of-factly. "He hasn't been hungry lately, but I leave it just the same."
- She does Alden's laundry. The descriptions of what she washes are... careful. She uses a great deal of bleach. She mentions stains with the same measured calm she uses for everything else.
- She has not answered the telephone in some time. It rang "for a while" but has stopped. She is relieved.
- The mail has accumulated. She sorts it into two piles — his and hers — and places his stack on his desk in the study, where it joins a considerable tower.
- She mentions, with mild irritation, that the Frazier boy from down the road has been "lurking about" — she has seen him at the fence line. She does not like visitors.

The Ishiguro voice deepens here: Elodie's narration is retrospective in tone. She occasionally says things like "I suppose some people might have found it difficult" or "I can see how that might seem unusual to someone who didn't understand" — she is aware that her situation is legible as wrong to outsiders, but she processes this awareness as evidence of the outside world's inadequacy, not her own.

### The Escalating Middle (pages 6-10, ~2,000 words): The Intrusion

The Frazier boy — Tommy Frazier, early twenties, home from college — becomes an increasingly persistent presence. He first appears at the fence, then at the gate, then on the porch. He says he's checking on her because no one has seen her in town for months. His mother sent him.

Elodie handles him the way Merricat handles outsiders: with polite hostility that she narrates as courtesy. She offers him lemonade on the porch (never inside). She answers his questions about Alden with perfect composure: "He's resting. He doesn't care for visitors." She is gracious. She is immovable.

Tommy is suspicious. He mentions that people in town are worried. He mentions the smell. Elodie explains about the salt marsh — the same explanation she gave the reader. He looks unconvinced.

The key scene in this section: Tommy asks to use the bathroom. Elodie, trapped by the rules of hospitality she was raised with, cannot refuse. She directs him to the powder room on the first floor. While he is inside, she stands at the bottom of the stairs, one hand on the banister, looking up. For the first time, the narration tightens — Elodie's measured calm develops an edge. She is not worried that Tommy will go upstairs. She is guarding the stairs the way you guard something precious. When Tommy emerges, she has lemonade ready and the front door open.

After he leaves, she goes upstairs. She opens the bedroom window. She adjusts the bedding. She speaks to Alden: tells him about the visitor, about the garden, about what she is making for dinner. Her voice — as narrated — is indistinguishable from any wife talking to any husband at the end of any day. The reader, by now, knows this is not what is happening.

### The Crisis Point (pages 10-13, ~1,500 words): The Almost-Seeing

Tommy returns, this time with an older woman — possibly his mother, possibly someone from the town. Elodie sees them from the upstairs window (she is with Alden) and does not go down. She watches them knock. She watches them try the gate. They call her name.

From the window, narrating, Elodie describes the scene below with the same calm she uses for everything. But here, a single paragraph breaks the surface. She thinks about the day Alden died. She narrates it the way Ishiguro's narrators narrate the central trauma: parenthetically, in passing, with devastating understatement.

She found him in the garden. A stroke, she believes. She brought him inside. She cleaned him up. She put him to bed. She made dinner.

She narrates this as if describing a day that was slightly more tiring than usual. The reader grasps that this was months ago. Possibly a year. She does not specify. Time, for Elodie, has become seasonal rather than calendrical — she measures it by what is blooming in the garden, not by dates.

The crisis: standing at the window, watching the people below, Elodie has a moment where the narration almost fractures. She begins a sentence: "I suppose if Alden were—" and does not finish it. She turns from the window. She adjusts the curtain. She goes downstairs and begins preparing dinner. Two plates.

She does not answer the door. Eventually, the visitors leave.

### The Ending (pages 13-15, ~600 words): The Return to Contentment

That evening. Elodie eats dinner alone at the table set for two. She carries Alden's plate upstairs. She describes her evening routine: washing up, checking the locks, winding the clock, banking the woodstove.

The final scene: She goes upstairs to say goodnight. She enters the bedroom. For the first time, the narration provides physical details of Alden that the reader has been dreading and expecting: the bedding is heavy with something, the lavender is thick, the window is open to the cold sea air. Elodie does not describe Alden directly. She describes what she does: she straightens the quilt, she adjusts the pillow, she tells him about tomorrow's plans — she will stake the tomatoes, there is bread to bake, the Frazier boy will probably come again but she will handle it.

She says goodnight. She closes the door. She goes to her own room (she has moved to the guest room — she mentions this offhandedly, "to let him rest without my tossing and turning").

The last paragraph: Elodie in her narrow bed, listening to the ocean, thinking about tomorrow's tasks with genuine pleasure. She is content. She is at peace. She is home.

The final sentence should feel like a door closing — warm from her side, terrible from ours.

## 4. Key Scenes

- **The tray scene (early)**: Elodie prepares a beautiful breakfast — soft-boiled eggs, toast cut into triangles, tea in the good china — carries it upstairs with care, narrates the arrangement of the tray on the bedside table. She returns later to find it untouched. "He wasn't hungry this morning. The eggs will keep." This is the first scene where a careful reader should feel the ground shift. It is presented as entirely routine.

- **The laundry scene (mid-early)**: Elodie doing Alden's laundry. She describes soaking the sheets in cold water with bleach, wringing them by hand (the washing machine upstairs is "too noisy for him"), hanging them on the line. The stains she is removing are never named. She treats them the way you treat grass stains or coffee spills — an ordinary nuisance. The physical specificity is Jackson-domestic: the weight of wet linen, the satisfaction of a clean line, the smell of bleach and sea air.

- **The bathroom scene (middle)**: Tommy Frazier asks to use the bathroom. The entire sequence is narrated as social comedy — Elodie's internal commentary on his manners, his muddy shoes, the presumption of the young. Underneath, the reader watches her position herself between Tommy and the staircase with the precision of a chess player. She never explains why she is standing there. She simply is.

- **The parenthetical death (late-middle)**: Elodie's one-paragraph account of the day Alden died. Told in the past tense, embedded within a longer passage about something else (the garden, probably — what was blooming when it happened). No drama. No grief. The facts, delivered with Ishiguro's devastating restraint: she found him, she brought him inside, she made him comfortable. Then she made dinner. The reader has to read it twice to absorb what it means.

- **The goodnight scene (ending)**: Elodie saying goodnight to Alden. The most physically specific scene in the story — the room, the air, the weight of the quilt, the lavender. Everything the narrator has carefully not described all story is almost-present here, still seen only through what she does (adjusts, straightens, opens the window wider) rather than what she sees. The reader fills in the rest. The narrator does not need to.

## 5. The Emotional Trajectory

**Elodie's trajectory**: Content ---> content ---> mildly annoyed by intrusion ---> protective ---> briefly threatened ---> restored to contentment.
She does not arc. She is a fixed point. That is the horror.

**The reader's trajectory**:

1. **Charmed** (opening): What a lovely, detailed portrait of a solitary domestic life. This woman loves her home, her garden, her husband.
2. **Curious** (early signals): Why doesn't Alden come downstairs? Why doesn't he eat? Something about the laundry...
3. **Uneasy** (the flies, the smell, the untouched food): Oh. Oh no. Is he—? But she seems so normal. Maybe I'm reading too much into this.
4. **Disturbed** (Tommy's visit, the bathroom scene): She is guarding the stairs. She knows what is up there. She knows what she is doing.
5. **Horrified** (the parenthetical death): She found him months ago. She brought him inside. She made dinner. She has been doing this EVERY DAY.
6. **Devastated** (the ending): She is not going to stop. She is going to do this tomorrow. And the next day. And no one is going to stop her because no one can get past the gate. And she is HAPPY. She is the happiest character in the story. That is the worst thing about it.

The final emotional note for the reader is not disgust but grief — Elodie's devotion is real. Her love for Alden is genuine. She has simply refused to let death be a reason to stop caring for the person she loves. The horror and the tenderness are the same thing.

## 6. Formula Integration

### Shirley Jackson (Author A) — Most visible in: The Frazier Boy scenes
Elodie's handling of Tommy is pure Merricat Blackwood. The polite hostility, the narrator who presents her own territorial aggression as courtesy, the absolute conviction that the outside world is the threat and the house is safety. Her internal commentary on Tommy — his manners, his shoes, his presumption — should have Jackson's signature tone: domestic judgment as warfare.

### Kazuo Ishiguro (Author B) — Most visible in: The parenthetical death and the "I suppose" constructions
Elodie's narration has Ishiguro's devastating restraint: she tells the reader everything but does not signal what matters. The key Ishiguro move is the "I suppose some people might find it" construction — the narrator who is aware of the outside perspective and simply does not share it. Her account of Alden's death, delivered parenthetically within a passage about gardening, is pure Ishiguro: the most important moment in the story told as if it were the least important.

### We Have Always Lived in the Castle (Work X) — Most visible in: The sealed world and the gate
The entire architecture of the story is Castle: the house as the protagonist's universe, the outside world as threat, domestic ritual as warding spell, the narrator whose reliability deteriorates with each page while her contentment never wavers. The gate Elodie checks every morning is Merricat's buried objects — a ritual of protection that is also a ritual of imprisonment. The story should feel, structurally, like living inside Merricat's head if Merricat had won completely and permanently.

### Never Let Me Go (Work Y) — Most visible in: The acceptance and the retrospective tone
The Ishiguro novel's core horror — the acceptance of one's own destruction, the gentle compliance with the monstrous — maps onto Elodie's acceptance not of her own destruction but of Alden's. She has accepted his death the way Kathy H. accepts the donations: not because she is weak or broken but because acceptance is the only mode of being she has. The retrospective tone ("I can see now that...") and the nostalgic warmth for something that was actually terrible are Never Let Me Go's fingerprints. The love story makes the horror worse: if Elodie didn't love Alden so genuinely, this would just be a story about madness. Because the love is real, it's a story about devotion that has outlived its object and become something monstrous.

## 7. Title

**Keeping House**

A domestic phrase — warm, ordinary, the province of women who tend hearths. It means to maintain a household. But "keeping" also means to retain, to hold, to refuse to let go. And a "house" in gothic fiction is never just a house. The title should read as perfectly innocent on the first encounter and deeply unsettling on the second.

  Jackson's domestic gothic isolation and the narrator-who-may-be-a-monster
  merge with Ishiguro's devastating restraint and compliant witness. A woman
  tends her home and her dead husband with equal care, narrating her sealed
  world with a contentment that the reader cannot share. The horror is not
  what she is doing — it is that she will never stop.
synopsis: >
  On a remote stretch of the Cape Cod coast, a woman maintains her house and
  garden with meticulous devotion, preparing meals for a husband who is
  resting upstairs. Her narration is warm, precise, and deeply content. The
  meals come back untouched. The laundry requires bleach. And outside the
  gate, the world is beginning to notice.
combination:
  fromAuthorA:
    - Domestic ritual as territorial control — gardening, cooking, and cleaning rendered as acts of sovereignty over a sealed world
    - The narrator who presents her own menace as courtesy, whose polite hostility toward outsiders reads as social comedy until it doesn't
    - The mundane elevated to the uncanny — breakfast trays, laundry, and lavender sachets carrying a weight the narrator refuses to acknowledge
  fromAuthorB:
    - Devastating understatement — the most important information delivered parenthetically, without emphasis, as if it barely matters
    - The narrator who is aware of the outside perspective and simply does not share it, whose "I suppose some people might find it" constructions reveal and conceal simultaneously
    - Acceptance as the deepest form of horror — not delusion but peace with what should be unbearable
  fromWorkX:
    - The house as sealed universe with the gate as boundary between safety and threat — Merricat's buried talismans reimagined as a checked latch
    - A narrator whose reliability erodes steadily while her contentment never wavers, inviting the reader to love and fear her simultaneously
    - A past catastrophe referenced with casual indifference, folded into the domestic routine like any other household fact
  fromWorkY:
    - The gentle acceptance of the monstrous — a love story that makes the horror worse because the devotion is genuine
    - Retrospective narration suffused with nostalgia for something the reader recognizes as terrible
    - The reader's understanding arriving before the narrator's, creating dramatic irony that builds to emotional devastation rather than shock

## Notes for the Writer Agent

**Prose voice**: First person, present tense for the main narration (she describes her days as she lives them), with occasional retrospective asides in past tense (Ishiguro's "I suppose, looking back..." constructions). The voice should be warm, measured, and precise — a woman who takes genuine pleasure in describing the weight of a tomato or the color of her preserves. Never hurried. Never worried.

**What NOT to do**:
- Do not make Elodie sympathetic through backstory or trauma explanation. Her contentment is the point. Do not explain it.
- Do not write a twist ending with a reveal scene. The reader should arrive at the truth gradually, through accumulation, and the story should never confirm it explicitly. Alden's condition is conveyed entirely through what Elodie does (the bleach, the lavender, the open windows, the untouched food) — never through what she says.
- Do not have Elodie break down, confess, or have a moment of clarity. The almost-seeing moment ("I suppose if Alden were—") is the closest she comes, and she steps back from it immediately.
- Do not use the word "corpse," "dead," "body," "decomposition," or any clinical language. Elodie does not use these words because she does not think in these categories.
- Do not name the smell. Elodie attributes it to the salt marsh. The reader knows better. That gap is the story.

**What TO do**:
- Physical, sensory detail in every scene. This is a story told through textures, smells, temperatures, and tastes. The domestic world must be so vivid that the reader can feel the weight of the wet linen, taste the lemonade, smell the lavender and — beneath it — the thing the lavender is there to cover.
- Let Elodie be genuinely likeable. The reader should want to live in her house, eat her food, walk her garden. The horror depends on the seduction working.
- Use the garden as a parallel text: things growing, things dying, things being cut back and composted. Elodie's garden is immaculate. The metaphor should never be stated.
- The ocean should be present throughout — audible, visible, smellable. It is the world beyond the gate. It is indifferent. It is the only thing larger than Elodie's devotion.
