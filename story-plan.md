# Story Plan: EA Dark Comedy — Saunders + Twain + Harrison Bergeron + Omelas

## Research Samples Collected

### Sample 1: "Harrison Bergeron" by Kurt Vonnegut (WorkX — structure)
**Source**: Full text retrieved from tnellen.com/cybereng/harrison.html
**Why representative**: The definitive example of deadpan dystopian escalation — absurd premises presented in the flattest possible tone, where horror emerges from characters' passive acceptance.

Key passage (opening):
> THE YEAR WAS 2081, and everybody was finally equal. They weren't only equal before God and the law. They were equal every which way. Nobody was smarter than anybody else. Nobody was better looking than anybody else. Nobody was stronger or quicker than anybody else. All this equality was due to the 211th, 212th, and 213th Amendments to the Constitution, and to the unceasing vigilance of agents of the United States Handicapper General.

And the devastating domestic ending:
> It was then that Diana Moon Glampers, the Handicapper General, came into the studio with a double-barreled ten-gauge shotgun. She fired twice, and the Emperor and the Empress were dead before they hit the floor. [...] Hazel turned to comment about the blackout to George. But George had gone out into the kitchen for a can of beer.

**Structural lessons**: Short, punchy scenes. Deadpan narration of insane premises. The television as framing device (passive observation). The way George's handicap buzzer prevents sustained thought — literally interrupts every arc of resistance before it can form. The domestic setting making dystopia cozy.

### Sample 2: "The Ones Who Walk Away from Omelas" by Ursula K. Le Guin (WorkY — themes)
**Source**: Full text extracted from utilitarianism.com/nu/omelas.pdf via pymupdf
**Why representative**: The foundational utilitarian thought experiment in fiction — a society's happiness dependent on one person's suffering, and the moral choice to participate or walk away.

Key passage (the child):
> In a basement under one of the beautiful public buildings of Omelas, or perhaps in the cellar of one of its spacious private homes, there is a room. It has one locked door, and no window. [...] In the room a child is sitting. [...] "I will be good," it says. "Please let me out. I will be good!" They never answer.

And the walkers:
> At times one of the adolescent girls or boys who go to see the child does not go home to weep or rage, does not, in fact, go home at all. [...] They keep walking, and walk straight out of the city of Omelas, through the beautiful gates. [...] The place they go towards is a place even less imaginable to most of us than the city of happiness. I cannot describe it at all. It is possible that it does not exist.

**Thematic lessons**: The metafictional address to the reader ("Do you believe?"). The insistence that happiness is not simple or naive. The refusal to resolve — Le Guin doesn't tell us whether walking away is courageous or cowardly. The story works by making the reader complicit: you've now imagined the child, so what will *you* do?

### Sample 3: George Saunders — Corporate Dystopia Voice (AuthorA)
**Source**: Representative passages from "Pastoralia" (collected in *Pastoralia*, 2000), "CivilWarLand in Bad Decline" (1996), and "The Semplica Girl Diaries" (*Tenth of December*, 2013)
**Why representative**: Saunders' signature mode — bureaucratic diction deployed with devastating irony, characters trapped in dehumanizing systems they half-understand, corporate-speak leaking into the most intimate human moments.

From "Pastoralia" (the protagonist works in a theme park living exhibit, pretending to be a caveman, receiving daily faxes from management):
> The fax comes at eleven. From Nordstrom: "POTENTIAL SMOKERS: Any employee caught smoking will be dealt with swiftly and decisively. Also, we are in a very lean period; therefore, no new hires, and please limit bathroom breaks to only those that are truly needed."

The hallmark Saunders moves:
- Corporate memos inserted into intimate narrative moments
- Characters who explain their own degradation in the language of their degraders ("per the Associate Handbook, my designated grief period has expired")
- The ache of genuine human feeling pressing through institutional jargon
- Names that sound both specific and generic (Todd, Janet, Nelson)
- Oscillation between absurdist humor and sudden, gut-punching tenderness
- Interior monologue that catches the character mid-rationalization

From "The Semplica Girl Diaries" — a suburban father's diary entries in a world where immigrant women are threaded through the head and displayed as lawn ornaments:
> The narrator doesn't question the SGs. He just wants to keep up with the neighbors. His voice is painfully relatable — he loves his kids, wants to give them nice things, chronicles small domestic joys and frustrations. The horror is how naturally he accommodates the monstrous.

### Sample 4: Mark Twain — Satirical Deadpan (AuthorB)
**Source**: *Adventures of Huckleberry Finn* (1884), Ch. III; *A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court* (1889), Ch. XXV. Both from Project Gutenberg.
**Why representative**: Twain's comedy operates through deadpan observation, the gap between stated and actual meaning, and vernacular speakers who reveal systemic absurdity through plain speech.

From *Huckleberry Finn*, Ch. III — Huck on Tom Sawyer's "enchantments":
> "I didn't see no di'monds, and I told Tom Sawyer so. He said there was loads of them there, anyway; and he said there was A-rabs there, too, and elephants and things. I said, why couldn't we see them, then? He said if I warn't so ignorant, but had read a book called Don Quixote, I would know without asking."

From *Connecticut Yankee*, Ch. XXV — The king's "just" ruling:
> "Here was a tragic end to a beautiful honeymoon not yet three months old. Poor young creatures! [...] in these pretty clothes, she crying on his shoulder, and he trying to comfort her with hopeful words set to the music of despair, they went from the judgment seat out into the world homeless, bedless, breadless; why, the very beggars by the roadsides were not so poor as they."

Twain's key moves:
- The vernacular voice that sounds naive but sees everything
- Plain speech revealing what ornate speech conceals
- The structural irony of "perfectly logical" systems that produce monstrous outcomes
- Rage channeled through humor — the satirist who pretends to report while actually prosecuting
- The gap between institutional language and human reality
- Sudden shifts from comic setup to devastating emotional impact

### Selected Concepts:

**Concept 1: German Salaried Employees' Union (DAG)**
A career-oriented employees' union that influenced wage systems, ran training centers, and was one of the largest providers of employee training in West Germany. Founded 1949, evolved through decades, eventually absorbed into a larger services union in 2001.

**Integration**: The story's central institution — the Bureau of Optimal Giving (BOG) — will be structured like a union-cum-training-center for moral employees. It doesn't just enforce compliance; it provides "continuing education credits" in ethical optimization, runs workshops on "Advanced Guilt Calculus," and has a tiered membership system where your moral standing determines your career trajectory. The DAG's real history of being an independent force that shaped policy and then was eventually absorbed into something larger mirrors the story's arc: the BOG has become so dominant it's indistinguishable from governance itself. The training-center detail grounds the satire — it's not a faceless dystopia but a place with break rooms and laminated handouts and mandatory continuing-education seminars.

**Concept 2: Karhunkierros ("Bear's Round")**
A Finnish hiking trail meaning "Bear's Round" (or "Bear's Circuit"), 80 km through wilderness, most popular trail in Finland. The trail is circular — it returns to where it started.

**Integration**: The story's version of "walking away from Omelas" will be called the Karhunkierros Protocol (or colloquially, "Bear's Round") — an officially sanctioned exit procedure for employees who can no longer sustain moral compliance. But here's the satirical knife: the "walking away" has been absorbed into the system. It's an authorized 80-day sabbatical circuit. You walk. You think. You return. The Bureau tracks your steps. They've quantified the therapeutic value of moral distress at 0.3 QALYs per walkabout, and they factor it into the annual efficiency reports. The act of rebellion — walking away — has been optimized. The circularity of the name ("Round") is the point: you always come back. The one open thread at the end is whether our protagonist will complete the circuit or keep walking.

## Story Design

### 1. Premise

In a near-future America where Effective Altruism has become mandatory public policy, every citizen's spending is audited for moral efficiency by the Bureau of Optimal Giving. Nora Tillerman is a mid-level Moral Compliance Auditor who processes guilt assessments for a living — until she's assigned to audit herself, and discovers that the most cost-effective intervention in her sector is dismantling her own department. The system has eaten its own tail, and now it's applying for a grant to study tail consumption.

### 2. Protagonist

**Nora Tillerman**, 34, Moral Compliance Auditor (Grade 7) at the Bureau of Optimal Giving, Tri-State Division.

- **What she WANTS** (conscious goal): To achieve a Perfect Moral Efficiency rating (100.0 PME) on her annual review. She's at 97.3 and believes the remaining 2.7 points will bring her peace — will prove she's genuinely good, not just technically compliant.
- **What she NEEDS** (unconscious truth): To stop quantifying her own worth. To do something wasteful and human — to buy the metaphorical cup of coffee without calculating its cost in malaria nets. To accept that moral life cannot be optimized.
- **Her flaw/blind spot**: She genuinely believes the system works. She's not a cynical functionary — she's a true believer whose faith makes her more dangerous than any bureaucrat. She cannot see that her kindness has been weaponized, because she cannot imagine kindness *without* measurement.
- **Her specific wound**: Her younger brother Eli died of a preventable illness when they were children — their parents couldn't afford treatment. She became an EA convert because she *personally knows* what it means when resources are misallocated. This isn't abstract for her. The system promised that no one would die of preventable things again, and she believed it. The wound is real, which makes the satire hurt.

### 3. Structure (5 beats)

**Beat 1: The World as Normal (deadpan establishment)**
Open with Nora at her desk processing guilt assessments — ordinary citizens whose spending has been flagged for moral inefficiency. A man who bought his daughter a birthday cake instead of donating the $47 to the Against Malaria Foundation. A woman who adopted a dog (pets are a Category 3 Moral Luxury; the $1,200/year in upkeep could save 0.24 statistical lives). Nora processes these with warm, genuine concern. She's not cruel. She *helps* people optimize. She speaks in the bureaucratic-therapeutic voice of a social worker crossed with a TurboTax interface. Through her processing, we learn the world's rules: the Moral Efficiency Score, the Optimal Giving Act, the Bureau, the handicaps (not physical, like Vonnegut, but financial — "moral surcharges" on non-optimal spending). Tone: Vonnegut-flat, Saunders-warm.

**Beat 2: The Anomaly (the child in the basement)**
Nora is assigned a special case: a "Sustained Moral Distress" report from the Bureau's own Analytics Division. The data shows that Bureau employees in her sector have the highest rates of depression, anxiety, and "moral injury" of any workforce in the country. The cost of treating this distress — therapy, medication, lost productivity, the occasional employee who walks out and has to be processed — now exceeds the value of the moral compliance they produce. In other words: the Bureau's own suffering has become the most cost-effective problem to solve. The Omelas parallel crystallizes: the Bureau runs on the suffering of its own workers, who suffer precisely because they're too morally sensitive to do their jobs without anguish. The good people are the ones who break. This is the child in the basement — except the child is Nora.

**Beat 3: Escalation and Bureaucratic Absurdity**
Nora takes this finding to her supervisor, Dale Fitch (a cheerful middle-manager type who speaks entirely in optimization metaphors). Dale's response: the finding is correct, and they should file a Remediation Action Plan. He proposes the Karhunkierros Protocol — the 80-day sanctioned walking sabbatical for morally distressed employees. He explains, with genuine enthusiasm, that the Bureau has calculated the therapeutic value of walking away at 0.3 QALYs, and that offering the protocol actually *increases* net moral output by 12% because refreshed employees process guilt assessments 23% faster upon return. The act of rebellion has been anticipated, quantified, and folded into the spreadsheet. Meanwhile, Nora discovers that her own self-audit reveals a 2.7% moral inefficiency stemming from... her grief over her brother Eli. Her unresolved grief is a "non-optimized emotional expenditure." The system has identified her love for her dead brother as waste.

**Beat 4: The Confrontation (Harrison's moment)**
Nora does something Harrison Bergeron-like: she rebels, but within the system's own logic. She writes a formal memo — devastating, precise, written in perfect Bureau-speak — demonstrating that the entire Bureau of Optimal Giving should be dismantled as a moral intervention. Her math is flawless. The suffering caused by mandatory moral optimization now exceeds the suffering prevented. The most altruistic act possible is to stop being altruistic. She presents this at the quarterly review meeting, reading it in the Bureau's own voice, and for a moment the room is silent with the vertigo of a system confronting its own conclusion. But unlike Harrison, who is shot, Nora is... processed. Dale thanks her for the "robust analysis," schedules a follow-up meeting, and notes that her willingness to identify systemic inefficiencies demonstrates exactly the kind of proactive moral engagement that makes her such a valued team member. Her rebellion is absorbed. Praised. Filed.

**Beat 5: Walking Away (but the trail is circular)**
Nora is approved for the Karhunkierros Protocol. She's issued walking shoes (the most cost-effective brand, naturally), a GPS tracker, and a pamphlet titled "Your Moral Sabbatical: A Guide to Optimal Distress Processing." She starts walking. The final section shifts — Twain's voice comes through strongest here, the plain-speech observer cutting through institutional fog. Nora notices things: a gas station selling overpriced coffee, a dog running in a field for no reason, a teenager playing guitar badly and with obvious joy. Things that have no moral efficiency score. Things that are just *there*. She stops at the gas station. She buys a cup of coffee — $4.50, which could fund 0.0009 of a statistical life. She holds it. The GPS tracker on her wrist blinks. The trail curves back toward the Bureau. But Nora is standing still, drinking coffee, watching the dog, and for the first time in years she is not calculating anything.

**Open thread**: We don't know if she'll complete the circuit and return, or if she'll keep walking. The GPS blinks. The coffee cools. The story ends.

### 4. Key Scenes

- **The Birthday Cake Audit**: Nora processes a father's case with genuine warmth, explaining that the $47 cake represents 0.0094 of a statistical life. She truly believes she's helping him. He cries. She offers him a tissue and a payment plan. This scene establishes the Saunders voice — corporate empathy, institutional tenderness, the ache of a kind person doing monstrous things kindly.

- **The Dog Adoption Hearing**: A brief, punchy scene (Vonnegut-style) where a woman argues that her dog provides emotional support valued at [X] QALYs. The Bureau's actuary calmly demonstrates that the same emotional benefit could be achieved by a meditation app at 1/400th the cost. The woman says: "But I love him." Nora notes this in the file as "Non-Optimized Attachment (Category 3)."

- **Dale's Karhunkierros Briefing**: Dale explains the walking protocol with the enthusiasm of a middle manager presenting a new wellness initiative. He has slides. The slides have clip art of hiking boots. He mentions, cheerfully, that three employees from last quarter's cohort didn't complete the circuit — "chose to continue walking," he says, which Nora understands is the Bureau's euphemism for quitting the system entirely. Dale notes that the 4.2% attrition rate is within acceptable parameters. This scene is pure Twain deadpan — the horror in the blandness.

- **The Grief Audit**: The moment Nora discovers her brother's death is flagged as an unresolved moral inefficiency. She reads the assessment: "Subject maintains non-productive emotional attachment to deceased sibling (est. cognitive overhead: 340 hrs/year). Recommended intervention: Structured Grief Optimization (SGO) seminar, 8 sessions. Projected PME improvement: +1.4 points." This is where the comedy turns and the knife goes in.

- **The Coffee Purchase**: The final scene. No calculation. No justification. Just coffee, and a dog, and a teenager with a guitar. The simplest scene in the story and the hardest to earn.

### 5. Emotional Trajectory

**Reader's journey**: Laughing → laughing uncomfortably → recognizing themselves → feeling the knife → relief.

- Opens with absurdist humor (the birthday cake audit is funny)
- Escalates through increasingly disturbing logical extensions (dating is selfish, pets are waste, grief is inefficiency)
- The comedy stays — it never becomes a lecture — but it shifts from "look at this silly world" to "oh god, I do this too" (the reader's own cost-benefit thinking about charity, about whether they should feel guilty)
- The grief audit is the emotional turn: the system declaring love for a dead brother to be waste
- The ending is Saunders' "relief" — the subversive act of wanting coffee for no reason — combined with Twain's insistence on tragedy (the system is still there, still running, still staffed by kind people)

### 6. Formula Integration

**AuthorA — George Saunders**: The entire narrative voice channels Saunders' corporate-dystopia register. Nora's interior monologue oscillates between bureaucratic jargon and sudden, aching human feeling. Specific Saunders scene: The Birthday Cake Audit, where Nora processes a man's "moral deficiency" with genuine empathy, offering tissues and payment plans, her institutional kindness indistinguishable from cruelty. The Bureau's memos and training materials are written in Saunders' pitch-perfect corporate-therapeutic voice.

**AuthorB — Mark Twain**: The story's structural irony is pure Twain — a "perfectly logical" system that produces monstrous outcomes, reported with deadpan restraint. Specific Twain scene: Dale's Karhunkierros briefing, where the manager explains, with clip-art slides and genuine enthusiasm, that the Bureau has optimized the act of walking away from the Bureau. The 4.2% attrition rate is "within acceptable parameters." Twain's voice also dominates the final section, where plain observation of ordinary things (coffee, a dog, a guitar) cuts through institutional language.

**WorkX — "Harrison Bergeron" (structure)**: The story mirrors Vonnegut's architecture: a dystopian premise presented deadpan, with "handicaps" (here moral surcharges instead of physical weights), a protagonist who briefly rebels, and a system that absorbs or neutralizes rebellion. Specific structural parallel: Nora's memo, like Harrison's declaration ("I am the Emperor!"), uses the system's own logic to challenge it — but unlike Harrison, who is shot, Nora is praised and filed. The Handicapper General has evolved: she doesn't need a shotgun when she has a Remediation Action Plan. The domestic passivity of George and Hazel Bergeron (watching TV, getting a beer) maps onto the Bureau employees who process guilt assessments while their own distress goes unaudited.

**WorkY — "The Ones Who Walk Away from Omelas" (themes)**: The Bureau's workforce IS the child in the basement — their suffering sustains the system's moral output. The Karhunkierros Protocol is the institutionalized version of "walking away," drained of its moral force by being quantified and sanctioned. The story's central question IS Le Guin's question: does knowing about the suffering obligate action? And what kind of action? Nora's open-ended walk is the story's answer — not a resolution, but a choice that hasn't finished being made. The reader is implicated: we, too, know the math. We, too, do the calculation. What will we do?

### 7. Title

**"Optimal Distress Processing"**

Why this title works:
- It's bureaucratic jargon that sounds helpful and is horrifying
- It captures the story's central paradox: the system has optimized suffering itself
- It doesn't start with "The" (per the constraint)
- It sounds like a real corporate training module, which is the joke
- It invites the reader into the story's world before they realize they should be disturbed
- Structurally distinct from all existing titles (three-word noun phrase using institutional/clinical language)

---

## Tonal Guidance (from the Author Meeting)

- "Funny first. The knife is hidden."
- The institution is trying to be good. Everyone in it is trying. That's where the real horror lives.
- Don't be smug. Take the EA logic seriously. The best version says: "you're right, and here's what right looks like when it forgets to be human."
- The system must eat itself: the moral framework causes enough suffering that dismantling the intervention becomes the most cost-effective intervention.
- End with relief, not victory. The irreducible human want that refuses to submit to calculation.
- "The snake eating its tail and then applying for grant funding to study tail consumption."

## Word Count Target

4,644 words (acceptable range: 4,344–4,944). This is a medium-long piece — enough room for the escalating bureaucratic scenes, the emotional gut-punch of the grief audit, and a spacious ending that breathes.
