## 1. Premise

A failed PhD student, fired from a rare books library for a theft he committed but was never formally charged with, has spent the last eight months living inside the identity of a recently deceased literary scholar — inhabiting the dead man's apartment, answering his emails, and finishing the dead man's book under his name. The story opens with the narrator at a faculty dinner, wearing a dead man's jacket, realizing that the woman across the table has recognized something wrong. The tension is not whether the fraud will be discovered but what happens to a person who has become so good at being someone else that there is nothing left underneath to return to.

## 2. Protagonist

**Name**: Julian Ault
**Age**: 29
**Situation**: A former doctoral candidate in Comparative Literature at a small, prestigious East Coast college (modeled on the Bennington/Reed/Williams world — a place where intellectual refinement is a social currency more valuable than money). His dissertation on Renaissance self-fashioning was never completed. He was quietly let go from his position at the college's rare books archive after a first edition of Montaigne's *Essais* went missing from a private collection he was cataloguing. The book was recovered; no charges filed; his academic career was over.

Six months later, his former professor and mentor — a respected but not famous literary critic named Aldous Fenwick, 64 — died of a heart attack alone in his off-campus cottage. Julian, who still had a key, found the body. Instead of calling anyone, he sat with it for two hours. Then he called the funeral home. Then he didn't leave.

**What Julian WANTS**: To finish Fenwick's book — a critical study of literary imposture titled *The Forger's Mirror* — and publish it under Fenwick's name. He tells himself this is an act of devotion, a final gift to his mentor. He wants to complete the work, see it published, and then quietly disappear. He wants to believe he is doing something noble.

**What Julian NEEDS**: To confront the fact that he is not preserving Fenwick's legacy — he is consuming it. He doesn't love literature or Fenwick; he loves the feeling of being someone who matters. He needs to understand that his emptiness is not a wound that happened to him but a condition he cultivates because it lets him become anyone.

**His flaw / blind spot (RISK CARD)**: Julian believes the impersonation is the problem — that if he can just keep the performance going long enough to finish the book, he can step back into his own life with the private satisfaction of having done something meaningful. He does not understand that there is no "own life" to step back into. The impersonation is not a disguise over a real self; it is the realest thing about him. The story reveals that what Julian IS — a person who fills himself with other people — is more dangerous and more permanent than anything he has done.

## 3. Structure

### Opening: The Crack in the Performance (approx. 800 words)

A faculty dinner at the college, late autumn. Julian is seated among scholars, wearing Aldous Fenwick's herringbone jacket. He has been living as a kind of ghost-Fenwick for eight months — not literally claiming to be him, but occupying his spaces, continuing his correspondence with a few distant colleagues who don't know Fenwick has died, and writing the final chapters of *The Forger's Mirror*. Most people on campus think Julian is simply house-sitting and handling the estate, which is technically true. But the dinner is a mistake — he has been avoiding social proximity to anyone who knew Fenwick well, and tonight he is too close.

The woman across the table is **Lena Brovik**, a visiting scholar from Oslo, who had a brief but intense intellectual affair with Fenwick two years ago. She is studying Julian with an expression he cannot read. The opening establishes: the crime is already in motion. We know what Julian is doing. The question is what it will cost.

### How We Got Here: The Seduction (approx. 1,500 words)

We pull back in time. Julian's history at the college — his arrival as a scholarship student among old-money aesthetes, his quick absorption into the intellectual life, his relationship with Fenwick (mentor, surrogate father, the first person who ever told him he was brilliant). The Montaigne theft — rendered not as a crime of greed but as an act of identification: Julian wanted to hold the book because Montaigne's essays on self-fashioning felt like the only text that had ever described what it was like to be him. The quiet expulsion. The months of nothing. Then Fenwick's death, the key, the body, the two hours of sitting.

The gradual slide into occupation: first just feeding Fenwick's cat. Then sleeping in the guest room. Then the study. Then answering an email from Fenwick's editor asking about the manuscript's progress. Then writing a paragraph. Then a page. Then chapters. The seduction of becoming a person who has a desk, a library, a purpose, a reputation (even borrowed). Julian's prose (the Fenwick chapters he writes) is actually better than Fenwick's original work, which makes the imposture feel less like theft and more like collaboration. This is where the reader gets seduced too — Julian is good at this, and we want him to succeed.

### The Escalating Middle: Complications and Cost (approx. 1,800 words)

Three pressure points converge:

1. **Lena Brovik** begins visiting the cottage. She says she wants to look through Fenwick's papers for letters he wrote her. Julian cannot refuse without raising suspicion. She is observant, she knew Fenwick intimately, and she notices things: the tea is wrong (Julian drinks Earl Grey; Fenwick drank Lapsang Souchong), the desk has been rearranged, there are new books on the shelf that don't match Fenwick's interests. She does not accuse Julian of anything. She simply watches, and her watching is unbearable.

2. **The manuscript** is nearly finished, and Fenwick's editor, **Patricia Oakes**, flies in from New York. She wants to meet with Julian to discuss the estate's handling of the book. Julian has been corresponding with her as "the estate executor" and has implied that the final chapters were found in draft form. Patricia is sharp, warm, and genuinely moved by the book. She says the last three chapters are "the best thing Aldous ever wrote." Julian experiences this compliment as both triumph and annihilation — the best work is his, but it will never be his.

3. **A letter arrives** from Fenwick's estranged sister in Montpelier, demanding to know why the estate hasn't been filed with probate court. Julian has been paying Fenwick's bills from Fenwick's accounts (power of attorney he forged). The legal structure is about to collapse.

Through this section, Julian's internal narration becomes increasingly Fenwick-like — adopting the dead man's cadences, opinions, even memories. He catches himself telling Lena an anecdote about a conference in Dubrovnik, then realizes it happened to Fenwick, not to him. The reader should feel the ground shifting: is Julian pretending to be Fenwick, or is Julian disappearing?

### The Crisis Point (approx. 800 words)

Lena comes to the cottage late one evening. She has found something in the papers Julian gave her access to — Fenwick's private journal, which Julian somehow missed. In it, Fenwick writes about Julian extensively. The entries are devastating: Fenwick saw Julian clearly. He describes Julian as "a brilliant mimic with no original self," a student whose gift for literary analysis was actually a gift for ventriloquism. Fenwick loved Julian but understood him with clinical precision: "He does not want to be a scholar. He wants to be *the kind of person who is a scholar.* The distinction is everything."

Lena reads Julian a passage. Julian listens. The scene is almost unbearable in its quietness — no confrontation, no shouting. Lena is not angry. She is something worse: she is sad for him. She says, "He knew. He knew what you would do." The implication — never stated outright — is that Fenwick may have left the key, the manuscript, the open door, as a kind of trap or a test, knowing exactly what Julian was.

### The Ending: Consequences, Not Justice (approx. 600 words)

Julian does not confess. He does not get caught. Lena leaves and does not call the police. The legal issue with the sister can probably be managed.

Instead, something worse happens: nothing changes. Julian finishes the book. He sends the final manuscript to Patricia. He feeds the cat. He sits at Fenwick's desk and begins reading Fenwick's journal from the beginning — not to understand Fenwick, but to study how Fenwick saw the world, so he can do it better next time.

The final image: Julian standing in front of Fenwick's bathroom mirror, practicing a facial expression he saw in a photograph of Fenwick at thirty. He adjusts his jaw, tilts his chin. It is the smallest, most devastating gesture — a man rehearsing someone else's face with the patience of a craftsman. The reader realizes: the story hasn't been about a crime. It's been about a condition. Julian will do this forever. There is no resolution because there is no Julian to resolve into.

## 4. Key Scenes

- **The faculty dinner** (opening): Julian in Fenwick's jacket, Lena's gaze across the table. The reader enters mid-crime. Tartt's lush, socially saturated academic world. The seduction of belonging to a world of candlelight and classical references.

- **The two hours with the body**: Julian finds Fenwick dead and simply sits. No panic, no grief — a strange, patient waiting, as if he were letting the apartment become available. This is the scene where Highsmith's cold moral vacuum is most visible. The reader should feel complicit: we understand why he doesn't call anyone immediately, and that understanding implicates us.

- **Patricia reads the final chapters aloud**: In the cottage study, Patricia reads a passage from the manuscript and begins to cry. She says it's the most personal thing Aldous ever wrote. Julian knows every word is his. The scene operates on three levels: Julian's private triumph, the fraudulence of the moment, and the genuine beauty of the work itself. The reader feels all three simultaneously.

- **Fenwick's journal entry**: Lena reads aloud Fenwick's private assessment of Julian. The precision of Fenwick's observation — "He does not want to be a scholar. He wants to be *the kind of person who is a scholar*" — functions as the story's thesis delivered as a wound. Julian does not argue. His silence is the loudest thing in the story.

- **The mirror** (final image): Julian rehearsing Fenwick's face. No narrative comment. No epiphany. Just the image of a man practicing how to be a person, alone, with the light failing.

## 5. The Emotional Trajectory

The reader's emotional journey moves through five phases:

1. **Fascination** (opening): Who is this person? What has he done? The academic world is gorgeous and the narrator is articulate and self-aware. We lean in.

2. **Seduction** (backstory): We understand why Julian did this. The emptiness of his expulsion, the beauty of Fenwick's life, the ease of the slide. We begin rooting for him. We want the book finished. We want him to get away with it.

3. **Unease** (escalating middle): Small wrongnesses accumulate. Julian's narration starts absorbing Fenwick's voice. Lena's quiet scrutiny makes us aware that we have been identifying with someone hollow. The complicity shifts from comfortable to uncomfortable.

4. **Recognition** (the journal): Fenwick's words hit the reader before they hit Julian. We see Julian the way Fenwick saw him — brilliant, hollow, dangerous in the way that empty things are dangerous because they fill themselves with whatever is closest. The emotional blow is not that Julian is a fraud but that he may be nothing else.

5. **Dread** (ending): The absence of consequences is the consequence. Julian will continue. He will find another life to inhabit. The reader leaves the story feeling not the catharsis of justice but the chill of recognition — we have all, at some point, performed a version of ourselves. Julian is what happens when the performance is all there is.

## 6. Formula Integration

### Author A — Donna Tartt
**Most visible in**: The faculty dinner scene and all descriptions of the college world. Lush, hypnotic sentences that make the academic setting feel like a drug — the candlelight on oak paneling, the way Latin phrases hang in conversation like expensive perfume, the particular intoxication of being admitted to a world of beauty and learning. Julian's narration in these passages should have Tartt's signature trance-state quality: long, rhythmic sentences heavy with sensory detail, obsessive cataloguing of textures and atmospheres, the way privilege feels to someone who grew up without it.

### Author B — Patricia Highsmith
**Most visible in**: The two hours with the body, and throughout Julian's internal narration when he is alone. Highsmith's influence is the cold engine beneath the lush surface. When Julian is thinking clearly — planning, calculating, maintaining the fraud — the prose should tighten, become clinical, almost affectless. The moral vacuum at the center of the story is Highsmith's territory: Julian does not agonize about what he's doing. He simply does it, the way a person breathes. The reader's discomfort comes from the absence of guilt, not its presence.

### Work X — The Secret History
**Most visible in**: The structural frame (crime revealed early, the story is about how we got here and what it costs) and the group dynamics of the college world. The opening dinner explicitly echoes the dinner scenes in *The Secret History* — the intoxication of intellectual aristocracy, the narrator as outsider admitted to the circle. Fenwick's small group of mentees and colleagues should feel like a version of Julian's Greek class: sealed, exclusive, operating under aesthetic principles that justify transgression. The shared secret (Fenwick's death, improperly handled) creates a bond between Julian and the reader that mirrors the bond between Richard and his classmates.

### Work Y — The Talented Mr. Ripley
**Most visible in**: Julian's relationship with Fenwick's identity and possessions. The precise, acquisitive way Julian catalogs what he has taken — the jacket, the desk, the handwriting, the intellectual opinions — mirrors Ripley's meticulous absorption of Dickie Greenleaf's life. The class aspiration is explicit: Julian came from nothing and Fenwick's life represents everything he believes a person should be. The final mirror scene is pure Ripley — the rehearsal of another person's face, the patient, workmanlike approach to becoming someone, the terrifying absence beneath the performance.

## 7. Title

**Visiting Fellow**

The title operates on multiple levels: Julian's quasi-official status at the college (he is, in a sense, visiting Fenwick's life); the academic title "visiting fellow" as a marker of the institutional world he craves entry to; the darker reading — he is a "fellow" who only "visits" other people's selves, never inhabiting his own. It is dry, institutional, and faintly sinister. It sounds like something you would see on a nameplate outside a door that belongs to someone else.
