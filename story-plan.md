## Writing Samples

### Sample 1: Terry Pratchett — The Wee Free Men (Work X)

**Source**: Work X — *The Wee Free Men*, Chapter 1: "A Clang Well Done"
**Origin**: Opening chapter, Penguin/HarperCollins editions
**Why representative**: Shows Pratchett's technique of building an entire worldview through a child's stubborn literalism, combining domesticity with the uncanny, and delivering character through action rather than description.

> Some things start before other things.
>
> It was a summer shower but it rained as fast as a winter one, soaking the grass and flattening it into a carpet that bled water at every step. Miss Perspicacia Tick sat in what little shelter a raggedy hedge could give her and explored the universe. She did it with a couple of twigs tied together with string, a stone with a hole in it, an egg, one of Miss Tick's stockings (which also had a hole in it), a pin, a piece of paper, and a tiny stub of pencil. It was amazing what you could find out with those things.
>
> [...]
>
> Tiffany Aching was lying on her stomach by the river, tickling trout. She liked to hear them laugh. It came up in bubbles.

Key Pratchett techniques visible here:
- **The deadpan absurd made real**: "She liked to hear them laugh. It came up in bubbles." A joke that is also literal, also worldbuilding.
- **Domestic objects elevated**: A frying pan, a piece of string, a stocking with a hole — these are the tools of magic and combat alike. Tiffany "unhooked the largest frying pan, the one that could cook breakfast for half a dozen people all at once."
- **Granny Aching's shadow**: "'Brides o' the sky', Granny Aching had called them once, and it was so rare that she ever said anything at all, let alone anything that wasn't to do with sheep, that Tiffany had remembered it." The absent mentor whose silence speaks louder than words.
- **Sheep as philosophy**: Granny Aching described sheep as "just bags of bones, eyeballs and teeth, lookin' for new ways to die." Comedy as precise observation. The joke IS the thesis.

Additional Pratchett voice markers from *The Wee Free Men*:
- "Yes! I'm me! I am careful and logical and I look up things I don't understand!"
- "It didn't stop being magic just because you found out how it was done."
- "Ordinary fortune-tellers tell you what you want to happen; witches tell you what's going to happen whether you want it to or not."
- "People who say things like 'May all your dreams come true' should try living in one for five minutes."
- "Speak up for those who don't have voices."
- "No one is actually dead until the ripples they cause in the world die away."

**Structural pattern from Work X**: A young protagonist who solves problems through cleverness and stubbornness rather than power. The fairy tale inverted. The home territory defended not through violence but through knowing it better than the invader. Tiffany brings a frying pan to fight a monster. She wins not because she's powerful but because she's practical, she's angry, and she knows her land.

### Sample 2: Robin Hobb — Assassin's Apprentice (Work Y)

**Source**: Work Y — *Assassin's Apprentice*, Chapter 1: "The Earliest History"
**Origin**: Opening pages, Bantam/Del Rey editions
**Why representative**: Demonstrates Hobb's retrospective first-person interiority, the ache of looking back at a self that didn't yet understand what was happening to it, and the way she grounds emotional devastation in physical, sensory detail.

> A history of the Six Duchies is of necessity a history of its ruling family, the Farseers. A complete telling would reach back beyond the founding of the First Duchy, and, if such names were remembered, would tell us of Outislanders raiding from the sea, visiting as pirates a shore more temperate and gentler than the icy beaches of the Out Islands.
>
> [...]
>
> My life has been a web of secrets, secrets that even now are unsafe to share. Shall I set them all down on fine paper, only to create from them flame and ash? Perhaps. My memories reach back to when I was six years old. Before that, there is nothing, only a blank gulf no exercise of my mind has ever been able to pierce. Prior to that day at Moonseye, there is nothing. But on that day they suddenly begin, with a brightness and detail that overwhelms me. Sometimes it seems too complete, and I wonder if it is truly mine. Am I recalling it from my own mind, or from dozens of retellings by legions of kitchen maids and ranks of scullions and herds of stable boys as they explained my presence to each other?

Key Hobb techniques visible here:
- **Retrospective grief**: The narrator looks back from a position of knowledge at a self that was innocent and confused, and the gap between those two selves IS the emotional engine.
- **Physical cost made tangible**: Everything in Hobb has a price paid in flesh. Magic costs. Duty costs. Even memory costs — "a brightness and detail that overwhelms me."
- **The imperfect mentor**: Burrich, who raises Fitz like a hound rather than a child. He loves the boy but doesn't know how to love a boy. "My silences he mistook for a lack of wit rather than a lack of any need to speak."

Additional Hobb voice markers from *Assassin's Apprentice*:
- "When you cut pieces out of the truth to avoid looking like a fool you end up looking like a moron instead."
- "Very little worth knowing is taught by fear."
- "Nothing takes the heart out of a man more than the expectation of failure."
- "Men cannot grieve as dogs do. But they grieve for many years."
- "One can only walk so far from one's true self before the bond either snaps, or pulls back."
- "And tomorrow we'll do the same again. And again. Until one day you get up and find out that whatever it was didn't kill you after all."

**Thematic pattern from Work Y**: The cost of duty. The mentor who loves imperfectly. Belonging to a place that uses you. The animal companion as the truest relationship. Identity forged through what you survive. Fitz is raised as a tool of the crown — loved, but instrumentally. His bond with Nighteyes (the wolf) is described by critic Amanda Craig as "as passionate as the deepest romantic love." The animal sees him whole when no human does.

### Sample 3: Terry Pratchett — General Discworld Voice (Author A)

**Source**: Author A style — *Small Gods*, *The Light Fantastic*, various Discworld
**Origin**: Opening passages and representative excerpts
**Why representative**: Shows Pratchett's range — the philosophical asides, the footnote voice, the way a sentence can pivot from absurdity to profundity without changing register.

> The sun rose slowly, as if it wasn't sure it was worth all the effort. Another Disc day dawned, but very gradually, and this is why. When light encounters a strong magical field it loses all sense of urgency. It slows right down. And on the Discworld the magic was embarrassingly strong, which meant that the soft yellow light of dawn flowed over the sleeping landscape like the caress of a gentle lover or, as some would have it, like golden syrup.
> — *The Light Fantastic*

> The tortoise is a ground-living creature. It is impossible to live nearer the ground without being under it. Its horizons are a few inches away. It has about as good a turn of speed as you need to hunt down a lettuce. It has survived while the rest of evolution flowed past it by being, on the whole, no threat to anyone and too much trouble to eat.
> — *Small Gods*

**Pratchett's prose mechanics**:
- Sentences that sound offhand but are structurally precise — conversational rhythm hiding careful construction
- The simile that undercuts itself ("like the caress of a gentle lover or, as some would have it, like golden syrup")
- Footnotes as worldbuilding, jokes, asides, philosophy, and commentary — "making the page itself into comedy"
- The joke that is ALSO the thesis — humor is never separate from meaning
- Compassion expressed through comedy, never through sentimentality

**From literary criticism** (David Bapst, L-Space analysis): Pratchett's evolution moved from "just gag books" to work where parody became inseparable from genuine emotion. Neil Gaiman: "Terry is just really good at human beings. He's good at genuine human emotions." The humor is the vehicle for emotional truth, not a shield against it.

### Sample 4: Robin Hobb — General Farseer Voice (Author B)

**Source**: Author B style — Farseer Trilogy, various
**Origin**: Interviews, critical analysis, representative passages
**Why representative**: Shows Hobb's approach to deep interiority, the animal bond, and the physical/emotional cost of everything.

From Robin Hobb interviews on craft:
> "I think a great deal of writing takes place in a part of my brain that I don't have conscious access to."
> "The things that happen to us change us... I think that is actually what makes a character interesting."
> "I find that some characters just have their own ideas about the story, and that if I let them have their way, the story becomes much more interesting."

**Hobb's prose mechanics**:
- First-person retrospective narration — the narrator knows more than their past self, and the gap is where the emotion lives
- Deep psychological interiority: Steven Erikson called it "a quiet seduction" and "handled with consummate control, precision and intent"
- The Los Angeles Review of Books described her work as offering "complete immersion in Fitz's complicated personality"
- Patient character development where growth is measured in years, not pages
- The physical and emotional cost of magic — nothing comes free
- The animal companion as the truest relationship — the Fitz/Nighteyes bond described as "as passionate as the deepest romantic love" (Amanda Craig, The Times, 2005)
- Prose described as having "a sinewy simplicity close to that of myths and fairytales"
- Vocabulary, cadence, and attitude shift with the character's emotional state — the prose IS the interiority

## Story Design

### 1. Premise

Bramble Hopworth, the only hedgewitch in the village of Underfold, discovers that the ancient beech tree at the center of the commons — the one that supposedly keeps the valley's weather mild and its harvests gentle — is dying from the inside. The tree has a Warden, a badger named Grisle who has been bonded to it for forty years, and Grisle is dying too. Bramble must find a way to save the tree (and Grisle, and the village's comfortable existence) not through any grand magic she doesn't possess, but by being more stubborn than rot, more patient than decay, and better acquainted with her own soil than the creeping blight that's eating both tree and badger from within.

The question the story asks: What do you owe to a place that shaped you but never thanked you — and what happens when the thing you've been quietly holding together finally asks you to let it change?

### 2. Protagonist

**Bramble Hopworth**, 58, hedgewitch of Underfold. Unmarried, not from tragedy but from the slow accretion of being too busy and too particular. She makes salves, talks to the bees, keeps the village's wards refreshed every equinox, and maintains the Listening — a low-grade magical bond with the land itself that lets her feel when the soil is tired or the creek is running wrong. She inherited the Listening from her aunt Sedge, who inherited it from her aunt before that.

- **What she WANTS**: To fix the tree. To keep things as they are. She's spent thirty years holding Underfold together with string and stubbornness and she's not about to stop now.
- **What she NEEDS**: To accept that some things can't be maintained — they can only be transformed. That holding on is not always the same as caring. That the tree (and Grisle, and she herself) need to become something new, not be preserved in amber.
- **Her flaw**: She conflates duty with identity so completely that she cannot imagine who she'd be without the work. She has never once asked what she wants because she's too busy doing what needs doing. She would call this selflessness. It's actually a kind of fear.
- **Endearing quality**: She talks to everything — the bees, the bread dough, the fence posts. Not because she thinks they're listening (she knows perfectly well fence posts don't listen; they're fence posts) but because she finds silence inefficient. She also keeps a running mental footnote on everything she observes, a habit of annotation that is both diagnostic tool and personality quirk.

### 3. Structure

**Opening image/scene**: Bramble is halfway up a ladder, arguing with a jackdaw that's stolen one of her glass ward-bottles from the cottage eave, when she feels it through the Listening — a wrongness in the commons beech. Not dramatic. Not a thunderclap. More like the moment you realize the kettle isn't just slow to boil; the flame has gone out. She climbs down, leaves the jackdaw to its thieving, and walks to the tree.

**The inciting disruption**: The beech's heartwood is rotting. Not ordinary rot — this is a magical blight, something that feeds on the bond between Warden and tree. Old Grisle the badger, who has been the tree's bonded Warden since before Bramble was born, is curled in his set beneath the roots, wheezing, his silver-streaked fur dull. The blight is killing them both. And because the tree anchors Underfold's climate ward, the village is going to start feeling it: frost where there shouldn't be frost, rain that forgets to stop, soil that turns sour.

**The escalating middle**: Bramble tries every remedy she knows — poultices on the bark, strengthening draughts for Grisle, a ward-circle around the roots. None of it works because she's treating symptoms. The village begins to notice: the baker's bread won't rise right, the apples taste of nothing, a late frost kills the early peas. The village council (five people and a disagreeable goat) wants answers. Bramble doesn't have them. She goes to consult Hazel Blackthorn, the nearest proper witch, who lives three valleys over and is 112 years old and mostly interested in her rock garden. Hazel tells her, with the bluntness of the very old: "You can't cure what's finishing. You can only help what's beginning." Bramble doesn't want to hear this.

**The crisis point**: Grisle, in a moment of lucidity, speaks to Bramble through the Listening — not in words, but in feelings. Forty years of bond-memories: the taste of earthworms after rain, the sound of children climbing the beech, the slow green patience of sapwood growing. And underneath it all, a readiness. Not despair. Acceptance. Grisle knows the tree's time has come, and his with it. What he's asking Bramble to do is not save them — it's help a new bond take root. There's a sapling growing from a beech-mast in the roots of the old tree. And there's a young badger, Grisle's last cub, nosing around the commons at dusk. Bramble has to let go of the old bond to midwife the new one.

**The ending**: Bramble performs the Passing — a ritual her aunt Sedge described once but that Bramble has never done, because it means accepting that the thing you've been tending is done. She sits with Grisle through his last night, feeling the old bond dissolve and the new one — tentative, fragile, entirely unproven — kindle between sapling and cub. The old beech will die. The new one will take decades to grow. Underfold's weather will be rough for a few years. But the bond is alive, and so is the Listening, and in the morning Bramble finds herself sitting on the commons with a young badger asleep against her knee and no idea what comes next — which, she realizes, might be the first truly interesting thing that's happened to her in thirty years.

**Open thread**: The young badger, not yet named, opens one eye and looks at Bramble with an expression that is either profound recognition or simple hunger. Bramble isn't sure which. She suspects she'll spend quite a long time finding out.

### 4. Key Scenes

1. **The Ladder and the Jackdaw** (opening): Bramble mid-argument with a bird, domestic chaos as the entry point, the Listening's alarm arriving not as drama but as a quiet wrongness — establishes the cozy tone and Pratchett's technique of building cosmic stakes from domestic absurdity. Also establishes Bramble's voice: practical, annotating, funny without trying to be.

2. **Grisle's Set** (early middle): Bramble crawls into the badger's burrow beneath the beech roots to check on him. She hasn't been down here in years. The passage is cramped, earthy, intimate. She finds Grisle diminished — his fur patchy, his breathing labored — and feels through the Listening the tree's pain as if it were her own arthritis, a deep ache in the joints of the world. This scene carries Hobb's interiority and the animal-bond tenderness. The physical cost of the bond made tangible.

3. **The Village Council** (mid-story): Five people, a disagreeable goat named Parliament, and Bramble trying to explain magical arboreal blight to people who think magic is "that thing Bramble does with the bees." Pratchett-inflected comedy: the village understands the crisis only when the baker's bread fails. Bread is real. Trees are just trees. But bread that won't rise? That's an emergency. Bramble realizes she's been holding the village together so seamlessly that they've forgotten the holding requires effort.

4. **Hazel Blackthorn's Garden** (turning point): The old witch's advice, delivered while repotting a succulent: "You can't cure what's finishing. You can only help what's beginning." Hazel is the imperfect mentor — she knows the answer but won't soften it. She also sees what Bramble can't: that Bramble's grief isn't about the tree. It's about the fear of not being needed. "You've been the mortar so long you've forgotten you're also a brick."

5. **The Passing** (climax): The ritual scene. Bramble sits with Grisle through the night, feeling forty years of bonded memory flow through the Listening. She has to actively release her grip — not on the tree, but on her certainty that maintaining is the same as caring. The new bond kindles: faint, wobbly, like a candle flame in a draft. Not a triumphant blaze. An uncertain beginning. This is the emotional peak — earned comfort, not easy comfort.

### 5. Emotional Trajectory

**Beginning**: The reader feels *settled* — this is a world of kettles and ward-bottles and argumentative jackdaws, and Bramble's voice is warm and wry and specific enough to feel like visiting someone's kitchen. Comfort as the baseline.

**Early middle**: A creeping *unease* beneath the comfort, as the wrongness in the tree registers. Not fear — this is cozy fantasy — but the particular anxiety of watching something you love start to fail. The reader feels protective of this world Bramble has built.

**Middle**: *Frustration and tenderness* in equal measure. Frustration because Bramble keeps trying to fix things with the tools she has and they aren't working. Tenderness because her stubbornness is so clearly an expression of love, even when it's misguided. The village council scene provides comic relief that also sharpens the stakes.

**Late middle / crisis**: *Grief that is also recognition*. When Grisle shares his bond-memories through the Listening, the reader should feel the weight of forty years of quiet service — the badger's lifetime of tending something larger than himself, without complaint, without thanks. And underneath: readiness. Not resignation. The difference matters.

**Ending**: The reader should feel *warm but not finished*. The old bond is gone. The new one is barely there. Bramble is sitting in the dawn with a young badger she doesn't know yet and a future she can't predict. It's not a resolution — it's a threshold. The warmth comes from the fact that she's still here, still listening, still willing. The reader puts this down feeling like they've had a good cry and a cup of tea afterward, and the tea is still warm.

### 6. Formula Integration

**Author A — Terry Pratchett** (satirical warmth, footnotes as worldbuilding, the joke that's also the thesis, compassion through comedy): **Most visible in**: Bramble's narrating voice throughout, but concentrated in the **Village Council scene**. The comedy of Parliament the goat, the baker's bread as the true measure of crisis, the villagers' cheerful obliviousness to the magic that sustains them — all of this is Pratchett's technique of finding the universal human truth inside the absurd particular. Bramble's running mental footnotes (observations that annotate the world as she moves through it — "*The jackdaw had been stealing ward-bottles all summer. Bramble suspected it liked the way they caught the light, which was fair enough; so did she.*") are a prose-level echo of Pratchett's footnote voice brought into close third person.

**Author B — Robin Hobb** (deep interiority, the physical/emotional cost of magic, bonds between humans and animals, patient development): **Most visible in**: The **Grisle's Set scene** and the **Passing ritual**. The Listening as a magical bond that carries physical sensation — feeling the tree's rot as joint-ache, feeling Grisle's exhaustion as her own breathlessness — is Hobb's signature technique of making magic cost something real and bodily. Bramble's interiority when she's alone with Grisle, the private tenderness of sitting with a dying animal companion, the understanding that passes between them without words — this is the Fitz/Nighteyes bond translated into a gentler register. The emotional cost of letting go, measured in the body.

**Work X — The Wee Free Men** (young protagonist solving problems through cleverness and stubbornness, fairy tale inverted, home territory defended through knowing it): **Most visible in**: The **overall structure** — Bramble defends her territory not through power (she's a hedgewitch, not an archmage) but through knowing her land better than the blight does. She crawls into a badger's burrow. She checks the soil pH by taste. She reads the wind. The fairy tale inverted: there is no villain, no dark lord, no invading army. The enemy is entropy, and the weapon is attention. Tiffany's frying pan becomes Bramble's poultice-pot. The stubbornness-as-heroism throughline is direct.

**Work Y — Assassin's Apprentice** (cost of duty, imperfect mentor, belonging to a place that uses you, animal companion as truest relationship, identity forged through survival): **Most visible in**: **Hazel Blackthorn's scene** and **Bramble's internal arc**. Hazel is the imperfect mentor — she has the wisdom but delivers it without cushioning, and she sees Bramble's blind spot before Bramble does. The cost of duty is Bramble's central wound: thirty years of holding Underfold together, and the village doesn't even know it needs holding. She belongs to a place that uses her. And Grisle — the animal companion who sees her whole, who shares forty years of wordless understanding through the bond — is the truest relationship in the story, just as Nighteyes is for Fitz. Identity forged through what you survive: Bramble survives the Passing, and what she finds on the other side is not triumph but the possibility of becoming someone new.

### 7. Title

**Hedgewitching for Beginners**

This title works because:
- Does not start with "The" (existing portfolio is at ~30%, needs to stay below threshold)
- Gerund structure ("Hedgewitching") — varied from the existing title patterns
- The "for Beginners" subverts expectations: Bramble is NOT a beginner; she's been doing this for thirty years. But the story's emotional arc is about discovering she's a beginner at the thing that actually matters — letting go, starting over, being uncertain. By the end, she genuinely is a beginner again.
- Echoes Pratchett's love of titles that are jokes with hidden teeth (cf. *The Wee Free Men*, *A Hat Full of Sky*, *I Shall Wear Midnight*)
- Has a cozy, inviting, approachable quality — you'd pick this up like you'd pick up a book called "Beekeeping for Beginners" at a village bookshop

## Notes for the Writer Agent

**Prose voice**: Close third person, past tense, with Bramble's interior commentary running as a warm, annotating presence throughout. The voice should feel like Pratchett's omniscient narrator squeezed into one character's perspective — wry, observational, structurally precise beneath the conversational surface. When the story reaches the Listening scenes (Grisle's set, the Passing), the voice should shift toward Hobb's register: slower, more sensory, more interior, the comedy dropping away not because it's forced out but because the moment is too real for jokes.

**What NOT to do**:
- Do NOT make the comedy broad. Pratchett's humor was precise, observational, grounded in specific human truths. No slapstick, no wackiness, no "zany magical village" energy.
- Do NOT make the emotional beats saccharine. The warmth should be earned. When Bramble cries, it should surprise her. When the bond kindles, it should be fragile and uncertain, not triumphant.
- Do NOT explain the themes. The story is about letting go, about the cost of duty, about the fear of not being needed — but these should be visible in what happens, not stated.
- Do NOT give Bramble a tidy epiphany. She doesn't "realize" anything in a clean sentence. She acts, and the understanding follows later, incomplete.
- Do NOT resolve every thread. The new bond is uncertain. The old beech is still dying. Underfold's weather will be rough. The young badger is unnamed. Leave room.

**What TO do**:
- Ground every scene in physical, sensory detail. The smell of the beech bark. The weight of Grisle's fur. The taste of soil. The sound of bees. The cozy world must be tangible enough to live in.
- Let Bramble be funny without trying to be funny. Her comedy comes from precision, not performance.
- Let the Listening be a fully realized magical system — subtle, bodily, integrated into how Bramble perceives the world. It's not a superpower; it's a way of paying attention that has a cost.
- Let Grisle be a character, not a symbol. He's an old badger. He's grumpy. He bites when his arthritis flares. He has been the tree's warden for forty years and he is tired, and his tiredness is dignified, not pathetic.
- Let the ending breathe. The last scene should feel like dawn — uncertain, quiet, open.
